Allah has indeed made excellent => اللّٰہُ لَہٗ رِزۡقًا

Allah has ordained for us => اللّٰہِ فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
Their Messengers said to them => اللّٰہِ فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ

So We sent revelation => فَاَوۡحَیۡنَاۤ
Then We revealed => فَاَوۡحَیۡنَاۤ
Then He revealed => فَاَوۡحٰۤی
and will bring them down => فَاَوۡرَدَہُمُ
and withheld => فَاَوۡعٰۤی
So give => فَاَوۡفُوا
so give => فَاَوۡفِ
so burn => فَاَوۡقِدۡ
So ruin seize => فَاَوۡلٰی
and woe again => فَاَوۡلٰی
and woe again => فَاَوۡلٰۤی
Then they both ate => فَاَکَلَا
devoured him => فَاَکَلَہُ
I would then be => فَاَکُوۡنَ
And wrought much => فَاَکۡثَرُوۡا
many a time => فَاَکۡثَرۡتَ
and honours him => فَاَکۡرَمَہٗ
and destroys it => فَاَہۡلَکَتۡہُ
And We destroyed => فَاَہۡلَکۡنَاۤ
and We destroyed them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
so We destroyed them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
then did We destroy them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
which then => فَاَیَّ
Then We gave power => فَاَیَّدۡنَا
Which\, then => فَاَیُّ
Whither\, then => فَاَیۡنَ
so withersoever => فَاَیۡنَمَا
and made to enter => فَاُدۡخِلُوۡا
I will punish them => فَاُعَذِّبُہُمۡ
were impelled to fall down => فَاُلۡقِیَ

they => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ
they are => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ

Allah only forbids you => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الظّٰلِمُوۡنَ

anything of what you have given them => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الظّٰلِمُوۡنَ
or send <i>them</i> away with kindness => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الظّٰلِمُوۡنَ

And let the People of the Gospel judge => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الۡفٰسِقُوۡنَ
it is they who are => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الۡفٰسِقُوۡنَ
those among you who believe => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الۡفٰسِقُوۡنَ
so that I may hide => فَاُوٰرِیَ
they were destroyed => فَاُہۡلِکُوۡا
then they are your brethren => فَاِخۡوٰنُکُمۡ
they are your brethren => فَاِخۡوٰنُکُمۡ
they are your brothers => فَاِخۡوٰنُکُمۡ
Have they a share in the kingdom => فَاِذًا لَّا یُؤۡتُوۡنَ النَّاسَ نَقِیۡرًا
Then would they not give men <i>even so much as</i> the little hollow in the back of a date-stone => فَاِذًا لَّا یُؤۡتُوۡنَ النَّاسَ نَقِیۡرًا
And so when => فَاِذَا

And whatever you spend => فَاِنَّ اللّٰہَ بِہٖ عَلِیۡمٌ
clear Signs We gave them => فَاِنَّ اللّٰہَ شَدِیۡدُ الۡعِقَابِ
there is a good example in them for you => فَاِنَّ اللّٰہَ ہُوَ الۡغَنِیُّ الۡحَمِیۡدُ
So we => فَاِنَّا
We shall surely => فَاِنَّا

then we => فَاِنَّا
we => فَاِنَّا
we shall indeed => فَاِنَّا
there is in that <em>land</em> a haughty and powerful people => فَاِنَّا دٰخِلُوۡنَ
Have they determined => فَاِنَّا مُبۡرِمُوۡنَ
<I>it makes little difference</I> => فَاِنَّمَا

So => فَاِنَّمَا
Then it will be => فَاِنَّمَا
it => فَاِنَّمَا
it only => فَاِنَّمَا

<I>the fact is that </I> => فَاِنَّہَا
Verily\, it shall be => فَاِنَّہَا
that indeed <em>proceeds </em> => فَاِنَّہَا
And they => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
and they will surely => فَاِنَّہُمۡ

for then they are => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
for they are => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
such indeed => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
they are => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
they too => فَاِنَّہُمۡ
He may turn to them in mercy => فَاِنَّہُمۡ ظٰلِمُوۡنَ
turn to them in mercy => فَاِنَّہُمۡ ظٰلِمُوۡنَ
turn to them with compassion => فَاِنَّہُمۡ ظٰلِمُوۡنَ

he is certainly => فَاِنَّہٗ
he surely => فَاِنَّہٗ
indeed => فَاِنَّہٗ

Therefore => فَاِنۡ
and\, if => فَاِنۡ
but if => فَاِنۡ
but if you have not gone in unto them => فَاِنۡ
then if => فَاِنۡ
then\, if => فَاِنۡ
then if => فَاِنۡۢ
Me alone => فَاِیّٰیَ
So fear Me alone => فَاِیّٰیَ فَارۡہَبُوۡنِ
it returns => فَآءَتۡ
they go back from the vow => فَآءُوۡ
so that it brings forth => فَاٰتَتۡ
Yet We gave => فَاٰتَیۡنَا
give to => فَاٰتُوا
So give them => فَاٰتُوۡہُمۡ
give them => فَاٰتُوۡہُنَّ
So give => فَاٰتِ
so give them => فَاٰتِہِمۡ
then two others => فَاٰخَرَانِ
punish them both => فَاٰذُوۡہُمَا
then makes it strong => فَاٰزَرَہٗ
and he believed => فَاٰمَنَ
And they believed => فَاٰمَنُوۡا
and we have believed => فَاٰمَنَّا
so we have believed => فَاٰمَنَّا
Believe\, therefore => فَاٰمِنُوۡا
So believe => فَاٰمِنُوۡا
believe therefore => فَاٰمِنُوۡا
but He sheltered you => فَاٰوٰٮکُمۡ
and give <em>thee </em>shelter => فَاٰوٰی
then write it down => فَاکۡتُبُوۡہُ
So write us down => فَاکۡتُبۡنَا
his mouth => فَاہُ
Then go down => فَاہۡبِطۡ
shun => فَاہۡجُرۡ
and lead them => فَاہۡدُوۡہُمۡ
Bring then => فَاۡتُوۡا
Bring\, then => فَاۡتُوۡا
So bring => فَاۡتُوۡا
Then bring => فَاۡتُوۡا
so approach => فَاۡتُوۡا
then produce => فَاۡتُوۡا
Bring us => فَاۡتُوۡنَا
in doubt concerning Allah => فَاۡتُوۡنَا بِسُلۡطٰنٍ مُّبِیۡنٍ
go in unto them => فَاۡتُوۡہُنَّ
Bring => فَاۡتِ
So bring => فَاۡتِ
then produce => فَاۡتِ
Bring us then => فَاۡتِنَا
Bring us\, then => فَاۡتِنَا
bring us => فَاۡتِنَا
So go => فَاۡتِیَا
So go ye both to him => فَاۡتِیَاہُ
then beware => فَاۡذَنُوۡا
give leave => فَاۡذَنۡ
then seek refuge => فَاۡوٗۤا
So they incurred => فَبَآءُوۡ
then accept their allegiance => فَبَایِعۡہُنَّ
Then he began => فَبَدَاَ
became manifest => فَبَدَتۡ
changed => فَبَدَّلَ
but Allah cleared him => فَبَرَّاَہُ
We gave her glad tidings => فَبَشَّرۡنٰہَا
So We gave him the glad tidings => فَبَشَّرۡنٰہُ
So give glad tidings => فَبَشِّرۡ
So announce to him => فَبَشِّرۡہُ
So give him the glad tidings => فَبَشِّرۡہُ
So give him the tidings => فَبَشِّرۡہُ
So give them tidings => فَبَشِّرۡہُمۡ
announce to them => فَبَشِّرۡہُمۡ
give to them the tidings => فَبَشِّرۡہُمۡ
thy sight => فَبَصَرُکَ
So she observed => فَبَصُرَتۡ
but he behaved arrogantly => فَبَغٰی
and they approach => فَبَلَغۡنَ
and they reach => فَبَلَغۡنَ
Cursed\, then => فَبُعۡدًا
And evil => فَبِئۡسَ
And evil is => فَبِئۡسَ
Evil is => فَبِئۡسَ
So what an evil => فَبِئۡسَ
What an evil => فَبِئۡسَ
most evil => فَبِئۡسَ
has not greeted thee => فَبِئۡسَ الۡمَصِیۡرُ
they had been forbidden => فَبِئۡسَ الۡمَصِیۡرُ
they were forbidden => فَبِئۡسَ الۡمَصِیۡرُ
In what => فَبِاَیِّ
Then in what => فَبِاَیِّ
Which then => فَبِاَیِّ
Which\, then => فَبِاَیِّ
therein => فَبِذٰلِکَ
So\, because of the transgression => فَبِظُلۡمٍ
So by Thy might => فَبِعِزَّتِکَ
Of what then => فَبِمَ
And it is by => فَبِمَا
So\, because => فَبِمَا
Then\, because of => فَبِمَا
it is because of what => فَبِمَا
Now\, since => فَبِمَاۤ
a young man => فَتًی
So He turned => فَتَابَ
Then He turned => فَتَابَ
and turned => فَتَابَ
so He has turned => فَتَابَ
wherefore He has turned => فَتَابَ
and you will come => فَتَاۡتُوۡنَ
and bring them => فَتَاۡتِیَہُمۡ
So blessed => فَتَبَارَکَ
So blessed be => فَتَبَارَکَ
Thereupon he smiled => فَتَبَسَّمَ
make proper investigation => فَتَبَیَّنُوۡا
ascertain <I>the correctness of the report </I>fully => فَتَبَیَّنُوۡۤا
so do make proper investigation => فَتَبَیَّنُوۡۤا
so that it will utterly confound them => فَتَبۡہَتُہُمۡ
has unfolded => فَتَحَ
and search => فَتَحَسَّسُوۡا
they opened => فَتَحُوۡا
freeing => فَتَحۡرِیۡرُ
shall free => فَتَحۡرِیۡرُ
We have granted => فَتَحۡنَا
We open => فَتَحۡنَا
We opened => فَتَحۡنَا
so that thou mayest fear => فَتَخۡشٰی
then he came down => فَتَدَلّٰی
so that you leave the other => فَتَذَرُوۡہَا
then wait => فَتَرَبَّصُوۡا
wait ye => فَتَرَبَّصُوۡا
wait\, therefore => فَتَرَبَّصُوۡا
Wait then => فَتَرَبَّصُوۡۤا
leaving it => فَتَرَکَہٗ
And thou wilt see => فَتَرَی
and thou seest => فَتَرَی
so that thou mightest have seen => فَتَرَی
so that thou seest => فَتَرَی
and thou seest it => فَتَرٰٮہُ
lest thou perish => فَتَرۡدٰی
and thou wilt be well pleased => فَتَرۡضٰۤی
then will you respond => فَتَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡنَ
<em>two</em> => فَتَشٰبَہَ
thou come to grief => فَتَشۡقٰۤی
became prolonged => فَتَطَاوَلَ
that thou shouldst drive them away => فَتَطۡرُدَہُمۡ
and he seized => فَتَعَاطٰی
come then => فَتَعَالَیۡنَ
But exalted => فَتَعٰلَی
Exalted then => فَتَعٰلَی
Exalted then be => فَتَعٰلَی
Exalted therefore is He => فَتَعٰلٰی
and you will know them => فَتَعۡرِفُوۡنَہَا
perdition is => فَتَعۡسًا
lest you falter => فَتَفۡشَلُوۡا
So do accept => فَتَقَبَّلۡ
But they (the people) have cut up => فَتَقَطَّعُوۡۤا
and said => فَتَقُوۡلُ
lest thou sit down => فَتَقۡعُدَ
but they doubted => فَتَمَارَوۡا
So enjoy yourselves => فَتَمَتَّعُوۡا
Well\, enjoy yourselves => فَتَمَتَّعُوۡا
and he appeared => فَتَمَثَّلَ
then wish => فَتَمَنَّوُا
So they called to one another => فَتَنَادَوۡا
persecute => فَتَنُوا
We did test => فَتَنَّا
We did try => فَتَنَّا
We tried => فَتَنَّا
tried => فَتَنَّا
We had tried him => فَتَنّٰہُ
they argued => فَتَنٰزَعُوۡۤا
into temptation => فَتَنۡتُمۡ
may benefit him => فَتَنۡفَعَہُ
then thou didst breathe => فَتَنۡفُخُ
and you will become => فَتَنۡقَلِبُوۡا
for then you will turn => فَتَنۡقَلِبُوۡا
the Holy Land => فَتَنۡقَلِبُوۡا خٰسِرِیۡنَ
So turn away => فَتَوَلَّ
So turn thou away => فَتَوَلَّ
Therefore turn thou away => فَتَوَلَّ
So they went away => فَتَوَلَّوۡا
But he turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
Then <em>Salih </em>turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
Then he turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
withdrew => فَتَوَلّٰی
put your trust => فَتَوَکَّلُوۡۤا
So put thy trust => فَتَوَکَّلۡ
then put thy trust => فَتَوَکَّلۡ
it be => فَتَکُنۡ
and be => فَتَکُوۡنَ
and thou become => فَتَکُوۡنَ
and thus be => فَتَکُوۡنَ
lest thou become => فَتَکُوۡنَ
or thou shalt be => فَتَکُوۡنَ
lest you be => فَتَکُوۡنَا
and it became => فَتَکُوۡنُ
so that you may become all => فَتَکُوۡنُوۡنَ
nd you disbelieved => فَتَکۡفُرُوۡنَ
wake up => فَتَہَجَّدۡ
two young men => فَتَیَانِ
betake yourselves => فَتَیَمَّمُوۡا
your maids => فَتَیٰتِکُمۡ
so that they raise => فَتُثِیۡرُ
which raise => فَتُثِیۡرُ
Then produce it => فَتُخۡرِجُوۡہُ
might have come to you => فَتُصِیۡبَکُمۡ
so that it will become => فَتُصۡبِحَ
and then become => فَتُصۡبِحُوۡا
to gush forth => فَتُفَجِّرَ
it was accepted => فَتُقُبِّلَ
lest thou be cast => فَتُلۡقٰی
turn you therefore => فَتُوۡبُوۡۤا
to emigrate => فَتُہَاجِرُوۡا
And these are => فَتِلۡکَ
And yonder => فَتِلۡکَ
a whit => فَتِیۡلًا
her slave-boy => فَتٰٮہَا
a victory => فَتۡحًا
decisively => فَتۡحًا
victory => فَتۡحًا
having <em>their </em>heads shaven => فَتۡحًا قَرِیۡبًا
you will have no fear => فَتۡحًا قَرِیۡبًا
victory => فَتۡحٌ
a break => فَتۡرَۃٍ
So He kept them back => فَثَبَّطَہُمۡ
so give firmness => فَثَبِّتُوا
there => فَثَمَّ
and they penetrated => فَجَاسُوۡا
and brought => فَجَآءَ
and they brought them => فَجَآءُوۡہُمۡ
its compensation => فَجَزَآءٌ
his reward shall => فَجَزَآؤُہٗ
He has in fact ordained for you => فَجَعَلَ
Then He made => فَجَعَلَ
And <em>thus </em>made them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
So he broke them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
Then turns it => فَجَعَلَہٗ
and has made for him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
and made him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
then you made => فَجَعَلۡتُمۡ
We turned => فَجَعَلۡنَا
Thus We made it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
We render it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
And We placed it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
and We shall scatter it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
so We made him => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
but We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمُ
and We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
so We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
And made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُنَّ
and concerted => فَجَمَعَ
Then shall We gather them => فَجَمَعۡنٰہُمۡ
were assembled => فَجُمِعَ
distant track => فَجٍّ عَمِیۡقٍ
every => فَجٍّ عَمِیۡقٍ
spacious hollow => فَجۡوَۃٍ
encompassed => فَحَاقَ
but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed => فَحَاقَ بِالَّذِیۡنَ سَخِرُوۡا مِنۡہُمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا بِہٖ یَسۡتَہۡزِءُوۡنَ
proclaim => فَحَدِّثۡ
And he gathered => فَحَشَرَ
becomes due => فَحَقَّ
justified => فَحَقَّ
with the result => فَحَقَّ
so My punishment rightly overtook<I> them</I> => فَحَقَّ عِقَابِ
So she conceived him => فَحَمَلَتۡہُ
but they acted unfaithfully towards them => فَخَانَتَاہُمَا
But the reward => فَخَرَاجُ
So he went forth => فَخَرَجَ
Then he came forth => فَخَرَجَ
so that the roof fell down => فَخَرَّ
and we feared => فَخَشِیۡنَاۤ
Then there came => فَخَلَفَ
Then there has come => فَخَلَفَ
then He shaped => فَخَلَقَ
then We fashioned => فَخَلَقۡنَا
then leave => فَخَلُّوۡا
take it => فَخُذُوۡہُ
then accept it => فَخُذُوۡہُ
then seize them => فَخُذُوۡہُمۡ
So take hold => فَخُذۡ
so take => فَخُذۡ
So hold them => فَخُذۡہَا
boastful => فَخُوۡرٌ
boaster => فَخُوۡرٍ
and entered => فَدَخَلُوۡا
Then he prayed => فَدَعَا
prayed => فَدَعَا
And they will call upon them => فَدَعَوۡہُمۡ
Then they will call on them => فَدَعَوۡہُمۡ
So he caused them to fall => فَدَلّٰٮہُمَا
and We destroy it => فَدَمَّرۡنٰہَا
then We destroyed them => فَدَمَّرۡنٰہُمۡ
destroyed => فَدَمۡدَمَ
and then crushed in => فَدُکَّتَا
And the earth and the mountains are heaved up => فَدُکَّتَا دَکَّۃً وّٰحِدَۃً
So it tasted => فَذَاقَتۡ
So they tasted => فَذَاقُوۡا
Then they slaughtered her => فَذَبَحُوۡہَا
So leave her => فَذَرُوۡہَا
so let her alone => فَذَرُوۡہَا
So leave Me => فَذَرۡنِیۡ
so leave them => فَذَرۡہُمۡ
so leave them alone => فَذَرۡہُمۡ
Admonish => فَذَکِّرۡ
Admonish then => فَذَکِّرۡ
So admonish => فَذَکِّرۡ
So go on reminding => فَذَکِّرۡ
lo! he <em>starts </em>offering long prayers => فَذُوۡ دُعَآءٍ عَرِیۡضٍ
So taste ye => فَذُوۡقُوا
Taste then => فَذُوۡقُوا
Taste ye => فَذُوۡقُوا
Taste\, then => فَذُوۡقُوا
Then taste => فَذُوۡقُوا
so now taste => فَذُوۡقُوا
taste therefore => فَذُوۡقُوا
taste it then => فَذُوۡقُوۡہُ
That => فَذٰلِکَ
That is the one => فَذٰلِکَ
Such is => فَذٰلِکُمُ
And this => فَذٰلِکُنَّ
So these => فَذٰنِکَ
Then he began suddenly => فَرَاغَ
Then he went secretly => فَرَاغَ
he went => فَرَاغَ
and they saw it => فَرَاَوۡہُ
and see him => فَرَاٰہُ
so that he looks upon it => فَرَاٰہُ
and your Lord => فَرَبُّکُمۡ
returned => فَرَجَعَ
Then they turned => فَرَجَعُوۡۤا
So We restored thee => فَرَجَعۡنٰکَ
then a man => فَرَجُلٌ

have settled => فَرَضۡتُمۡ
We have enjoined => فَرَضۡنَا
thou art free => فَرَغۡتَ
We have revealed in pieces => فَرَقۡنٰہُ

then <i>say your Prayer</i> on foot => فَرِجَالًا
he rejoices => فَرِحَ
rejoiced => فَرِحَ
they became exultant => فَرِحُوۡا
they exulted => فَرِحُوۡا

it adds => فَزَادَتۡہُمۡ
it increases their => فَزَادَتۡہُمۡ
has increased their => فَزَادَہُمُ
but this <i>only</i> increased => فَزَادَہُمۡ
and they <em>thus</em> increased => فَزَادُوۡہُمۡ
terror => فَزَعٍ
Then We shall separate => فَزَیَّلۡنَا
<em>appear</em> beautiful => فَزَیَّنَ
made <em>to appear</em> attractive => فَزَیَّنُوۡا
so add to him => فَزِدۡہُ
they will be smitten with fear => فَزِعُوۡا
corruption => فَسَادًا
create disorder => فَسَادًا
disorder => فَسَادًا
for creating disorder => فَسَادٍ
so I will ordain it => فَسَاَکۡتُبُہَا
and evil => فَسَآءَ
and evil was => فَسَآءَ
it shall be an evil => فَسَآءَ
<em>let him remember that</em> an evil companion is he => فَسَآءَ قَرِیۡنًا
the Last Day => فَسَآءَ قَرِیۡنًا
And he cast lots => فَسَاہَمَ
But glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
So glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
do thou glorify Him => فَسَبِّحۡہُ
So you will soon remember => فَسَتَذۡکُرُوۡنَ
And you will soon know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
Then will you know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
and you will know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
And thou wilt soon see => فَسَتُبۡصِرُ
in the houses wherein you dwell => فَسَتُرۡضِعُ لَہٗۤ اُخۡرٰی
then another <em>woman shall</em> suckle <em>the child </em>for him (the father => فَسَتُرۡضِعُ لَہٗۤ اُخۡرٰی
and they <em>all </em>submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
and they <i>all</i> submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
and they all submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
So We subjected => فَسَخَّرۡنَا
disobedient => فَسَقُوۡا
rebel => فَسَقُوۡۤا
So he watered => فَسَقٰی
salute => فَسَلِّمُوۡا
Then ‘Peace => فَسَلٰمٌ
We will facilitate for him => فَسَنُیَسِّرُہٗ
We will make easy for him => فَسَنُیَسِّرُہٗ
then perfected thee => فَسَوّٰٮکَ
and made it (destruction => فَسَوّٰٮہَا
and made it perfect => فَسَوّٰٮہَا
and He perfected them => فَسَوّٰٮہُنَّ
and perfected => فَسَوّٰی
and perfects => فَسَوّٰی
But they will soon => فَسَوۡفَ
We shall soon => فَسَوۡفَ
and <I>the punishment of your rejection </I> => فَسَوۡفَ
and soon => فَسَوۡفَ
but soon => فَسَوۡفَ
but you shall soon => فَسَوۡفَ
soon => فَسَوۡفَ
then => فَسَوۡفَ
then <em>let it be known that in his stead</em> => فَسَوۡفَ
we shall certainly => فَسَوۡفَ
I gave you leave => فَسَوۡفَ تَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
I give you leave => فَسَوۡفَ تَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
But soon will they come to know => فَسَوۡفَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
but they will soon => فَسَوۡفَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
they disbelieve therein => فَسَوۡفَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
for they will soon see => فَسَوۡفَ یُبۡصِرُوۡنَ
but soon there will come to them => فَسَیَاۡتِیۡہِمۡ
He will gather them => فَسَیَحۡشُرُہُمۡ
Surely\, the Messiah will never => فَسَیَحۡشُرُہُمۡ اِلَیۡہِ جَمِیۡعًا
will surely see => فَسَیَرَی
and soon they will know => فَسَیَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
they will realize => فَسَیَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
Then they will say => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
Then will they ask => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
They will say => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
He will surely give him => فَسَیُؤۡتِیۡہِ
breaks => فَسَیُؤۡتِیۡہِ اَجۡرًا عَظِیۡمًا
He will surely admit them => فَسَیُدۡخِلُہُمۡ
They will then shake => فَسَیُنۡغِضُوۡنَ
They will surely continue to spend it => فَسَیُنۡفِقُوۡنَہَا
Glorified then => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
So Holy => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
So glorify => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
but far away => فَسُحۡقًا
then do We drive them => فَسُقۡنٰہُ
So go about => فَسِیۡحُوۡا
so travel => فَسِیۡرُوۡا
But ask them => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡہُمۡ
ask them => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡہُنَّ
So ask => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡۤا
so ask those => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡۤا
ask => فَسۡـَٔلِ
but ask => فَسۡـَٔلِ
Ask thou then => فَسۡـَٔلۡ
So ask => فَسۡـَٔلۡ
and ask him => فَسۡـَٔلۡہُ
the evidence => فَشَہٰدَۃُ
bind fast => فَشُدُّوا
you became lax => فَشِلۡتُمۡ
And will drink => فَشٰرِبُوۡنَ
Drinking => فَشٰرِبُوۡنَ
then let fall => فَصَبَّ
He replied\, ‘Nay\, but your souls have embellished to you this thing. So <em>now </em>comely patience <I>is good for me</I> => فَصَبۡرٌ
then she has spoken the truth => فَصَدَقَتۡ
And a witness of her household bore witness <em>saying</em> => فَصَدَقَتۡ وَہُوَ مِنَ الۡکٰذِبِیۡنَ
and has thus hindered them => فَصَدَّہُمۡ
and thus turned them away => فَصَدَّہُمۡ
and they turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
and turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
thus they turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
and turned away => فَصَرَفَ
departed => فَصَلَتِ
So pray => فَصَلِّ
and offers Prayers => فَصَلّٰی
and smote => فَصَکَّتۡ
and make them attached => فَصُرۡہُنَّ
must fast => فَصِیَامُ
shall fast => فَصِیَامُ
should fast => فَصِیَامُ
He has already explained => فَصَّلَ
We have explained => فَصَّلۡنَا
We have explained => فَصَّلۡنٰہُ
which We have expounded => فَصَّلۡنٰہُ
and she <em>too </em>was frightened => فَضَحِکَتۡ
So We sealed => فَضَرَبۡنَا
smite => فَضَرۡبَ
Thus they have gone astray => فَضَلُّوۡا
and have thus gone astray => فَضَلُّوۡا
Then there will be set up => فَضُرِبَ
has favoured => فَضَّلَ
exalted us => فَضَّلَنَا
He has exalted you => فَضَّلَکُمۡ
exalted you => فَضَّلۡتُکُمۡ
We exalt => فَضَّلۡنَا
We exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
We have exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
have We exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
Through the grace => فَضۡلًا

grace => فَضۡلًا
some good fortune => فَضۡلٌ
Gracious => فَضۡلٍ
bounty => فَضۡلٍ
is gracious => فَضۡلٍ
merit => فَضۡلٍ
And had it not been for Allah’s repelling => فَضۡلٍ عَلَی الۡعٰلَمِیۡنَ
and David slew Jalut => فَضۡلٍ عَلَی الۡعٰلَمِیۡنَ
And Allah had surely made good to you => فَضۡلٍ عَلَی الۡمُؤۡمِنِیۡنَ
superiority => فَضۡلٍۭ
His grace => فَضۡلَہٗ
grace => فَضۡلُ
the grace => فَضۡلُ
bounty => فَضۡلِ
grace => فَضۡلِ
His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖ
given them of His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖ
His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖۤ
visited => فَطَافَ
was prolonged => فَطَالَ
He has created => فَطَرَ
created => فَطَرَ
created us => فَطَرَنَا
created me => فَطَرَنِیۡ
created me => فَطَرَنِیۡۤ
created you => فَطَرَکُمۡ
made them => فَطَرَہُنَّ
Then he began => فَطَفِقَ
divorce them => فَطَلِّقُوۡہُنَّ
We blinded => فَطَمَسۡنَاۤ
purify => فَطَہِّرۡ
So a seal was set => فَطُبِعَ
but they unjustly rejected => فَظَلَمُوۡا
will bow ... => فَظَلَّتۡ
and they began => فَظَلُّوۡا
then you would keep => فَظَلۡتُمۡ
and he thought => فَظَنَّ
and realize => فَظَنُّوۡۤا
rough => فَظًّا
then when you retaliate => فَعَاقَبۡتُمۡ
then punish => فَعَاقِبُوۡا
But they rebelled => فَعَتَوۡا
then wondrous => فَعَجَبٌ
and He has given => فَعَجَّلَ
then proportioned thee aright => فَعَدَلَکَ
and he knew them => فَعَرَفَہُمۡ
We strengthened => فَعَزَّزۡنَا
Maybe => فَعَسَی
Perhaps => فَعَسٰی
it may be => فَعَسٰۤی
maybe => فَعَسٰۤی
And they disobeyed => فَعَصَوۡا
disobeyed => فَعَصٰی
but We pardoned => فَعَفَوۡنَا
and hamstrung => فَعَقَرَ
Then they hamstrung => فَعَقَرُوا
But they hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
and hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
dealt => فَعَلَ
did => فَعَلَ
has done => فَعَلَ
have done => فَعَلَ
was done => فَعَلَ
after them => فَعَلَ الۡمُبۡطِلُوۡنَ
done this => فَعَلَہٗ
on me => فَعَلَیَّ
then it is your duty => فَعَلَیۡکُمُ
against it => فَعَلَیۡہَا
does so to its detriment => فَعَلَیۡہَا
it is to his own harm => فَعَلَیۡہَا
on him => فَعَلَیۡہِ
suffer => فَعَلَیۡہِ
then in Him => فَعَلَیۡہِ
will bear => فَعَلَیۡہِ
on them => فَعَلَیۡہِمۡ
they shall have => فَعَلَیۡہِنَّ
had done => فَعَلُوۡا
have done => فَعَلُوۡا
they commit => فَعَلُوۡا
they have done => فَعَلُوۡہُ
which they committed => فَعَلُوۡہُ
But He knew => فَعَلِمَ
and He knew => فَعَلِمَ
Then they will know => فَعَلِمُوۡۤا
hast done => فَعَلۡتَ
thou didst => فَعَلۡتَ
thou didst so => فَعَلۡتَ
you did => فَعَلۡتُمۡ
you have done => فَعَلۡتُمۡ
I did do it => فَعَلۡتُہَاۤ
I did it => فَعَلۡتُہٗ
they do => فَعَلۡنَ
We dealt => فَعَلۡنَا
so they became blind => فَعَمُوۡا
has been rendered obscure => فَعُمِّیَتۡ
then <em>know that </em>the prescribed period for them => فَعِدَّتُہُنَّ
the same number => فَعِدَّۃٌ
admonish them => فَعِظُوۡہُنَّ
but with => فَعِنۡدَ
with => فَعِنۡدَ
Doer => فَعَّالٌ
bring about => فَعَّالٌ
do thy deed => فَعۡلَتَکَ
overwhelmed them => فَغَشِیَہُمۡ
So that there covered them => فَغَشّٰٮہَا
So He forgave => فَغَفَرَ
So We forgave => فَغَفَرۡنَا
so his life became miserable => فَغَوٰی
Thus were they vanquished => فَغُلِبُوۡا
and fetter him => فَغُلُّوۡہُ
We opened => فَفَتَحۡنَاۤ
then We opened them => فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا
So I fled => فَفَرَرۡتُ
some => فَفَرِیۡقًا
And We did give Moses the Book => فَفَرِیۡقًا کَذَّبۡتُمۡ وَفَرِیۡقًا تَقۡتُلُوۡنَ
and to Jesus\, son of Mary\, We gave => فَفَرِیۡقًا کَذَّبۡتُمۡ وَفَرِیۡقًا تَقۡتُلُوۡنَ
and he was afraid => فَفَزِعَ
will be struck with terror => فَفَزِعَ
and he disobeyed => فَفَسَقَ
but they transgress => فَفَسَقُوۡا
<i>should make</i> an expiation => فَفِدۡیَۃٌ
Flee ye therefore => فَفِرُّوۡۤا
in => فَفِیۡ
they will be => فَفِیۡ
Saying => فَقَالَ
Yet he says => فَقَالَ
and he said => فَقَالَ
and said => فَقَالَ
he said => فَقَالَ
replied => فَقَالَ
said => فَقَالَ
say => فَقَالَ
then he said => فَقَالَ
who said => فَقَالَ
so she said => فَقَالَتۡ
And they said => فَقَالُوۡا
But they said => فَقَالُوۡا
They will say => فَقَالُوۡا
and said => فَقَالُوۡا
and they say => فَقَالُوۡا
And they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
and said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
but they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
partly => فَقَبَضۡتُ
he slew him => فَقَتَلَہٗ
so he killed him => فَقَتَلَہٗ
and straitens => فَقَدَرَ
Thus did We measure => فَقَدَرۡنَا
certainly => فَقَدِ
has indeed => فَقَدِ
has surely => فَقَدِ
shall => فَقَدِ
surely => فَقَدِ
then they will surely => فَقَدِ
and proportions him => فَقَدَّرَہٗ
ordained for it => فَقَدَّرَہٗ
give => فَقَدِّمُوۡا
<em>also</em> => فَقَدۡ
<em>it matters not</em> => فَقَدۡ
Now have => فَقَدۡ
So => فَقَدۡ
There => فَقَدۡ
certainly => فَقَدۡ
doubtless => فَقَدۡ
even so => فَقَدۡ
had <em>also </em> => فَقَدۡ
has indeed => فَقَدۡ
he indeed => فَقَدۡ
indeed => فَقَدۡ
indeed been => فَقَدۡ
now => فَقَدۡ
shall => فَقَدۡ
surely => فَقَدۡ
then => فَقَدۡ
then verily => فَقَدۡ
thereof => فَقَدۡ
undoubtedly => فَقَدۡ
verily => فَقَدۡ
and other people have helped him with it => فَقَدۡ جَآءُوۡ ظُلۡمًا وَّزُوۡرًا
in the truth which has come to you => فَقَدۡ ضَلَّ سَوَآءَ السَّبِیۡلِ
we threw them => فَقَذَفۡنٰہَا
And he had read it => فَقَرَاَہٗ
he placed it => فَقَرَّبَہٗۤ
were hardened => فَقَسَتۡ
So He completed them => فَقَضٰٮہُنَّ
so that it tears => فَقَطَّعَ
fall ye down => فَقَعُوۡا
Little => فَقَلِیۡلًا
Ruin seize him => فَقُتِلَ
was cut off => فَقُطِعَ
say => فَقُل
say then => فَقُل
speak => فَقُل
say => فَقُلِ
And say => فَقُلۡ
Then say => فَقُلۡ
say => فَقُلۡ
say <em>to him</em> => فَقُلۡ
And I said => فَقُلۡتُ
So We said => فَقُلۡنَا
Then We said => فَقُلۡنَا
and We said => فَقُلۡنَا
and We shall say => فَقُلۡنَا
But speak => فَقُوۡلَا
and say => فَقُوۡلَاۤ
and say => فَقُوۡلُوا
then say => فَقُوۡلُوا
say => فَقُوۡلِیۡۤ
save us\, then => فَقِنَا
poor => فَقِیۡرًا
need => فَقِیۡرٌ
poor => فَقِیۡرٌ
fight => فَقٰتِلَاۤ
fight the party => فَقٰتِلُوا
then fight => فَقٰتِلُوۡۤا
Fight\, therefore => فَقٰتِلۡ
<em>shall come </em> => فَلَا
<em>shall come </em>no => فَلَا
And none => فَلَا
But no => فَلَا
So be not => فَلَا
So let not => فَلَا
Then there will be no => فَلَا
and cannot => فَلَا
and not => فَلَا
and you shall not => فَلَا
but => فَلَا
do not => فَلَا
has no => فَلَا

so that no => فَلَا
then it shall be no => فَلَا
then she is not => فَلَا
then there shall be no => فَلَا
there can be no => فَلَا
there is no => فَلَا
there is none => فَلَا
there shall be no => فَلَا
therefore => فَلَا
they cannot => فَلَا
will have no => فَلَا
will not => فَلَا
so put me not to shame => فَلَا تَفۡضَحُوۡنِ
and thou shalt forget <em>it </em>not => فَلَا تَنۡسٰۤی
Shall I seek for judge other than Allah => فَلَا تَکُوۡنَنَّ مِنَ الۡمُمۡتَرِیۡنَ
and give me no time => فَلَا تُنۡظِرُوۡنِ
How many a city => فَلَا نَاصِرَ لَہُمۡ
And for those => فَلَا یَسۡتَعۡجِلُوۡنِ
so let them not ask Me to hasten => فَلَا یَسۡتَعۡجِلُوۡنِ
it would have been better for them and more upright => فَلَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ اِلَّا قَلِیۡلًا
who pervert words from their <em>proper</em> places => فَلَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ اِلَّا قَلِیۡلًا
I will therefore surely cut off => فَلَاُقَطِّعَنَّ
But nay => فَلَاۤ
Nay => فَلَاۤ
it shall be no => فَلَاۤ
then => فَلَاۤ
there will be no => فَلَاۤ
Evil indeed => فَلَبِئۡسَ
and he dwelt => فَلَبِثَ
so he remained => فَلَبِثَ
thou didst tarry => فَلَبِثۡتَ
so that thou shouldst know them => فَلَعَرَفۡتَہُمۡ
So haply thou => فَلَعَلَّکَ
thou art now perhaps => فَلَعَلَّکَ
curse => فَلَعۡنَۃُ
then they would have surely fought you => فَلَقٰتَلُوۡکُمۡ
and they had felt it => فَلَمَسُوۡہُ
And when => فَلَمَّا
And\, when => فَلَمَّا
But when => فَلَمَّا
So when => فَلَمَّا
So\, when => فَلَمَّا
Then\, when => فَلَمَّا
but since => فَلَمَّا
when Zaid had => فَلَمَّا
yet when => فَلَمَّا
But when => فَلَمَّاۤ
So\, when => فَلَمَّاۤ
and when => فَلَمَّاۤ
So => فَلَمۡ
and shall not => فَلَمۡ
but => فَلَمۡ
but they will not => فَلَمۡ
has only => فَلَمۡ
But we shall assuredly bring thee => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّکَ
we shall surely come to them => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّہُمۡ
And We will certainly question => فَلَنَسۡـَٔلَنَّ
Then will We certainly relate => فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ
We will surely grant him => فَلَنُحۡیِیَنَّہٗ
Then We will surely tell => فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ
surely\, then\, will We make thee turn => فَلَنُوَلِّیَنَّکَ
and what an excellent => فَلَنِعۡمَ
I will\, therefore => فَلَنۡ
cannot => فَلَنۡ
never => فَلَنۡ
never => فَلَنۡ
no => فَلَنۡ
not => فَلَنۡ
shall not => فَلَنۡ
thou shalt not find a way => فَلَنۡ تَجِدَ لَہٗ سَبِیۡلًا
thou shalt not find for him a helper => فَلَنۡ تَجِدَ لَہٗ نَصِیۡرًا
they will never accept it => فَلَنۡ یَّہۡتَدُوۡۤا اِذًا اَبَدًا
If => فَلَوۡ
Would => فَلَوۡ
Why\, then => فَلَوۡلَا
Why\, then\, does not => فَلَوۡلَا
and had it not been => فَلَوۡلَا
then\, do you not reflect => فَلَوۡلَا تَذَکَّرُوۡنَ
Why\, then\, are you not grateful => فَلَوۡلَا تَشۡکُرُوۡنَ
Why\, then\, do you not accept <em>the truth</em> => فَلَوۡلَا تُصَدِّقُوۡنَ
And why have not => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
Why\, then => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
an orbit => فَلَکٍ

Let them\, then\, bring forth => فَلۡیَاۡتُوۡا

then should the believers put their trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
then\, let the believers put their trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
let all who would trust put their trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُتَوَکِّلُوۡنَ
who trust put their trust. => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُتَوَکِّلُوۡنَ
Let them\, therefore\, fear => فَلۡیَتَّقُوا
So let => فَلۡیَحۡذَرِ
Then let him call => فَلۡیَدۡعُ
So let them taste it => فَلۡیَذُوۡقُوۡہُ
So let them ascend => فَلۡیَرۡتَقُوۡا
So they should hearken => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡا
and let them answer => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡا
let him abstain => فَلۡیَسۡتَعۡفِفۡ
they <em>too</em> should ask permission => فَلۡیَسۡتَـٔۡذِنُوۡا
let him fast therein => فَلۡیَصُمۡہُ
They must laugh => فَلۡیَضۡحَکُوۡا
They should worship => فَلۡیَعۡبُدُوۡا
then\, let the workers work => فَلۡیَعۡمَلِ الۡعٰمِلُوۡنَ

then <em>remember that</em> Allah has allowed you no way <em>of aggression</em> against them => فَمَا جَعَلَ اللّٰہُ لَکُمۡ عَلَیۡہِمۡ سَبِیۡلًا

But all that which they earned was of no avail to them => فَمَاۤ اَغۡنٰی عَنۡہُمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا یَکۡسِبُوۡنَ
so We gave them provision => فَمَتَّعۡنٰہُمۡ
So make some provision for them => فَمَتِّعُوۡہُنَّ
a temporary enjoyment => فَمَتٰعُ
only a temporary provision => فَمَتٰعُ
His case therefore => فَمَثَلُہٗ

some of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ

But they called => فَنَادَوۡا
They cried out <em>for help</em> => فَنَادَوۡا
Then he called her => فَنَادٰٮہَا

and proclaimed => فَنَادٰی
and wait to see => فَنَاظِرَۃٌۢ
But they threw it away => فَنَبَذُوۡہُ
I cast away => فَنَبَذۡتُہَا
Then We cast him => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُ
and cast them => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُمۡ
and threw them => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُمۡ
we would disown => فَنَتَبَرَّاَ
that we might have followed => فَنَتَّبِعَ
We delivered thee => فَنَجَّیۡنٰکَ

so We saved him => فَنَجَّیۡنٰہُ
and invoke => فَنَجۡعَل
But We leave => فَنَذَرُ
but they too have forgotten => فَنَسُوۡا
So he gave up => فَنَسِیَ
but he forgot => فَنَسِیَ
so He has neglected them => فَنَسِیَہُمۡ
and thou didst disregard them => فَنَسِیۡتَہَا
Then he cast => فَنَظَرَ
we continue => فَنَظَلُّ
so that we might do => فَنَعۡمَلَ
so We breathed => فَنَفَخۡنَا
profited them => فَنَفَعَہَاۤ
they went => فَنَقَّبُوۡا
that we might be => فَنَکُوۡنَ
then was saved => فَنُجِّیَ

Then <em>for him will be </em>an entertainment => فَنُزُلٌ

it shall be as if => فَکَاَنَّمَا

then she has lied => فَکَذَبَتۡ

aye\, they rejected => فَکَذَّبُوۡا
But they accused him of falsehood => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
But they called him a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
But they rejected him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they declared him to be a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they rejected him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
but they treated him as a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they called them liars => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
and they rejected them both => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
but we treated <em>him </em>as a liar => فَکَذَّبۡنَا
likewise => فَکَذٰلِکَ
Certainly you would loathe it => فَکَرِہۡتُمُوۡہُ
then We clothed => فَکَسَوۡنَا
and removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا
now We have removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا

So they disbelieved => فَکَفَرُوۡا

but He withheld => فَکَفَّ
The expiation for this => فَکَفّٰرَتُہٗۤ

We gave them guidance => فَہَدَیۡنٰہُمۡ

they will be goaded on => فَہُمۡ یُوۡزَعُوۡنَ
He => فَہُوَ

who becomes => فَہُوَ
And his eyes became white => فَہُوَ کَظِیۡمٌ

so that it is => فَہِیَ
till they => فَہِیَ
And this is => فَہٰذَا
But it will come upon them => فَیَاۡتِیَہُمۡ

lest a near punishment seize you => فَیَاۡخُذَکُمۡ عَذَابٌ قَرِیۡبٌ
Then He spreads it => فَیَبۡسُطُہٗ
So men learnt => فَیَتَعَلَّمُوۡنَ
and follow => فَیَتَّبِعُوۡنَ
pursue => فَیَتَّبِعُوۡنَ
then cast them => فَیَجۡعَلَہٗ

they will swear => فَیَحۡلِفُوۡنَ
flows => فَیَخۡرُجُ

And He will leave them => فَیَذَرُہَا
it goes away => فَیَذۡہَبُ
and heap them up => فَیَرۡکُمَہٗ
and he feels shy => فَیَسۡتَحۡیٖ
They thus deride => فَیَسۡخَرُوۡنَ
to intercede => فَیَشۡفَعُوۡا
should feel tempted => فَیَطۡمَعَ
so that they become => فَیَظۡلَلۡنَ
to offer excuses => فَیَعۡتَذِرُوۡنَ
know => فَیَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
then will He forgive => فَیَغۡفِرُ
he despairs\, <em>and </em>gives up <em>all </em>hope => فَیَـُٔوۡسٌ قَنُوۡطٌ

they would say => فَیَقُوۡلُوۡا
say => فَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
they slay => فَیَقۡتُلُوۡنَ
and dies => فَیَمُتۡ
that they may die => فَیَمُوۡتُوۡا
it stays => فَیَمۡکُثُ
will punish => فَیَنۡتَقِمُ
<em>that </em>He may then see => فَیَنۡظُرَ
and seen => فَیَنۡظُرُوۡا
so that they might see => فَیَنۡظُرُوۡا
that they might see => فَیَنۡظُرُوۡا
so that they might go back => فَیَنۡقَلِبُوۡا
On that day => فَیَوۡمَئِذٍ
On that day will => فَیَوۡمَئِذٍ
So on that day => فَیَوۡمَئِذٍ
that he might be => فَیَکُوۡنَ
and he was => فَیَکُوۡنُ
and it is => فَیَکُوۡنُ

it will be => فَیَکُوۡنُ
lest they contrive => فَیَکِیۡدُوۡا
then will He remove => فَیَکۡشِفُ
and they will be seized => فَیُؤۡخَذُ
and thus may make lawful => فَیُحِلُّوۡا
and press you => فَیُحۡفِکُمۡ
and quickens => فَیُحۡیٖ
will admit them => فَیُدۡخِلُہُمۡ
so that they may <em>also </em>be pliant => فَیُدۡہِنُوۡنَ
then send => فَیُرۡسِلَ
lest He destroy you => فَیُسۡحِتَکُمۡ
He smites => فَیُصِیۡبُ
and smites => فَیُصِیۡبُ
Then will they become => فَیُصۡبِحُوۡا
he will be crucified => فَیُصۡلَبُ
lest it should lead thee astray => فَیُضِلَّکَ
He will increase it => فَیُضٰعِفَہٗ
that He may multiply => فَیُضٰعِفَہٗ
will punish him => فَیُعَذِّبُہُ
He will punish them => فَیُعَذِّبُہُمۡ
Who will punish him => فَیُعَذِّبُہٗ
and drown you => فَیُغۡرِقَکُمۡ
be he slain => فَیُقۡتَلۡ
the two <em>latter witnesses </em>shall swear => فَیُقۡسِمَانِ
they shall both swear => فَیُقۡسِمَانِ
And then He retains => فَیُمۡسِکُ
