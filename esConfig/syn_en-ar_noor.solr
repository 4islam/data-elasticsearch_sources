seized them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ
overtook them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ
Then I seized them => فَاَخَذۡتُہُمۡ

then We bring forth => فَاَخۡرَجۡنَا
We bring forth => فَاَخۡرَجۡنَا

desired => فَاَرَادَ
Thus they intended => فَاَرَادُوۡا

So we desired => فَاَرَدۡنَاۤ
sent => فَاَرۡسَلَ

but you may help me => فَاَعِیۡنُوۡنِیۡ
but We drowned him => فَاَغۡرَقۡنٰہُ
and drowned them => فَاَغۡرَقۡنٰہُمۡ
so We drowned them => فَاَغۡرَقۡنٰہُمۡ
So We have caused => فَاَغۡرَیۡنَا
and have covered them => فَاَغۡشَیۡنٰہُمۡ
and enriched => فَاَغۡنٰی
And we caused you to go astray => فَاَغۡوَیۡنٰکُمۡ

and assigns a grave to him => فَاَقۡبَرَہٗ
came forward => فَاَقۡبَلَتِ
Thereupon <em>the people </em>came => فَاَقۡبَلُوۡۤا
So set => فَاَقِمۡ

then observe => فَاَقِیۡمُوا
many a time => فَاَکۡثَرۡتَ
And wrought much => فَاَکۡثَرُوۡا
and honours him => فَاَکۡرَمَہٗ
Then they both ate => فَاَکَلَا
devoured him => فَاَکَلَہُ
I would then be => فَاَکُوۡنَ
and He united => فَاَلَّفَ
and lay it => فَاَلۡقِہۡ
Then will they offer => فَاَلۡقَوُا
Thereupon\, they will retort => فَاَلۡقَوۡا
So they threw down => فَاَلۡقَوۡا
and lay it => فَاَلۡقُوۡہُ
and cast him => فَاَلۡقُوۡہُ
So he flung down => فَاَلۡقٰی
So he threw down => فَاَلۡقٰی
were made to fall down => فَاُلۡقِیَ
were impelled to fall down => فَاُلۡقِیَ
So he cast it down => فَاَلۡقٰٮہَا
So do ye twain cast him => فَاَلۡقِیَاہُ
then cast him => فَاَلۡقِیۡہِ
And He revealed to it => فَاَلۡہَمَہَا
Now => فَاَمَّاۤ
But => فَاَمَّا

So => فَاَمَّا
will I bestow benefits => فَاُمَتِّعُہٗ
then either retain them => فَاَمۡسِکُوۡہُنَّ
then confine them => فَاَمۡسِکُوۡہُنَّ
keep them => فَاَمۡسِکُوۡہُنَّ
then rain down => فَاَمۡطِرۡ
but He gave <em>thee</em> power => فَاَمۡکَنَ

his <em>nursing </em>mother => فَاُمُّہٗ
I => فَاَنَا۠

and We produce => فَاَنۡۢبَتۡنَا
Then We cause to grow => فَاَنۡۢبَتۡنَا
thou dost => فَاَنۡتَ
dost thou => فَاَنۡتَ
so that you become => فَاَنۡتُمۡ
and saved you => فَاَنۡجَیۡنٰکُمۡ

And We saved him => فَاَنۡجَیۡنٰہُ
But We saved him => فَاَنۡجَیۡنٰہُ
and We saved them => فَاَنۡجَیۡنٰہُمۡ
and warn => فَاَنۡذِرۡ
So I warn you => فَاَنۡذَرۡتُکُمۡ
and He sent down => فَاَنۡزَلَ
sent down => فَاَنۡزَلَ
So We sent down => فَاَنۡزَلۡنَا
then We send down => فَاَنۡزَلۡنَا
and has made them forget => فَاَنۡسٰٮہُمۡ
and whom He has <em>consequently</em> caused to forget => فَاَنۡسٰٮہُمۡ
And We produced => فَاَنۡشَاۡنَا
then grant me respite => فَاَنۡظِرۡنِیۡۤ
then I will breathe => فَاَنۡفُخُ
spend => فَاَنۡفِقُوۡا
and He saved you => فَاَنۡقَذَکُمۡ

then did We destroy them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
so We destroyed them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
and We destroyed them => فَاَہۡلَکۡنٰہُمۡ
they were destroyed => فَاُہۡلِکُوۡا
conceived => فَاَوۡجَسَ
And he felt => فَاَوۡجَسَ
Then He revealed => فَاَوۡحٰۤی
So We sent revelation => فَاَوۡحَیۡنَاۤ
Then We revealed => فَاَوۡحَیۡنَاۤ
and will bring them down => فَاَوۡرَدَہُمُ
so that I may hide => فَاُوٰرِیَ
and withheld => فَاَوۡعٰۤی
so give => فَاَوۡفِ
So give => فَاَوۡفُوا
so burn => فَاَوۡقِدۡ
those => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ
these are => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ
it is these => فَاُولٰٓئِکَ

So enjoy yourselves => فَتَمَتَّعُوۡا
and he appeared => فَتَمَثَّلَ
then wish => فَتَمَنَّوُا
We tried => فَتَنَّا
tried => فَتَنَّا
We did test => فَتَنَّا
We did try => فَتَنَّا
So they called to one another => فَتَنَادَوۡا
an affliction => فِتۡنَۃً
a trial => فِتۡنَۃً
trial => فِتۡنَۃً
a trial => فِتۡنَۃٌ
persecution => فِتۡنَۃٌ

your torment => فِتۡنَتَکُمۡ
into temptation => فَتَنۡتُمۡ
their mischief => فِتۡنَتُہُمۡ
to try => فِتۡنَتَہٗ
they argued => فَتَنٰزَعُوۡۤا
then thou didst breathe => فَتَنۡفُخُ
may benefit him => فَتَنۡفَعَہُ
and you will become => فَتَنۡقَلِبُوۡا
for then you will turn => فَتَنۡقَلِبُوۡا
We had tried him => فَتَنّٰہُ
persecute => فَتَنُوا
to emigrate => فَتُہَاجِرُوۡا
wake up => فَتَہَجَّدۡ
turn you therefore => فَتُوۡبُوۡۤا
then put thy trust => فَتَوَکَّلۡ
So put thy trust => فَتَوَکَّلۡ
put your trust => فَتَوَکَّلُوۡۤا
So turn thou away => فَتَوَلَّ
So turn away => فَتَوَلَّ
Therefore turn thou away => فَتَوَلَّ
So they went away => فَتَوَلَّوۡا
Then <em>Salih </em>turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
Then he turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
withdrew => فَتَوَلّٰی
But he turned away => فَتَوَلّٰی
in various ways => فُتُوۡنًا
a young man => فَتًی
her slave-boy => فَتٰٮہَا
two young men => فَتَیَانِ
young men => فِتۡیَۃٌ
your maids => فَتَیٰتِکُمۡ
a whit => فَتِیۡلًا
betake yourselves => فَتَیَمَّمُوۡا
so give firmness => فَثَبِّتُوا
So He kept them back => فَثَبَّطَہُمۡ
there => فَثَمَّ
and brought => فَجَآءَ
and they brought them => فَجَآءُوۡہُمۡ
wide => فِجَاجًا
and they penetrated => فَجَاسُوۡا
are made to flow forth => فُجِّرَتۡ
its compensation => فَجَزَآءٌ
his reward shall => فَجَزَآؤُہٗ
He has in fact ordained for you => فَجَعَلَ
Then He made => فَجَعَلَ
then you made => فَجَعَلۡتُمۡ
We turned => فَجَعَلۡنَا
and We shall scatter it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
so We made him => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
And We placed it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
Thus We made it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
We render it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
but We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمُ
and We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
so We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
And made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُنَّ
So he broke them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
And <em>thus </em>made them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
and has made for him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
and made him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
Then turns it => فَجَعَلَہٗ
and concerted => فَجَمَعَ
were assembled => فَجُمِعَ
Then shall We gather them => فَجَمَعۡنٰہُمۡ
spacious hollow => فَجۡوَۃٍ
wrong for it => فُجُوۡرَہَا
encompassed => فَحَاقَ
proclaim => فَحَدِّثۡ
a foul deed => فٰحِشَۃً
a foul thing => فٰحِشَۃً
And he gathered => فَحَشَرَ
becomes due => فَحَقَّ
justified => فَحَقَّ
with the result => فَحَقَّ
So she conceived him => فَحَمَلَتۡہُ
but they acted unfaithfully towards them => فَخَانَتَاہُمَا
So take hold => فَخُذۡ
so take => فَخُذۡ
So hold them => فَخُذۡہَا
then accept it => فَخُذُوۡہُ
take it => فَخُذُوۡہُ
then seize them => فَخُذُوۡہُمۡ
so that the roof fell down => فَخَرَّ
But the reward => فَخَرَاجُ
Then he came forth => فَخَرَجَ
So he went forth => فَخَرَجَ
and we feared => فَخَشِیۡنَاۤ
Then there has come => فَخَلَفَ
Then there came => فَخَلَفَ
then He shaped => فَخَلَقَ
then We fashioned => فَخَلَقۡنَا
then leave => فَخَلُّوۡا
boastful => فَخُوۡرٌ
boaster => فَخُوۡرٍ
ransom => فِدَآءً
and entered => فَدَخَلُوۡا
Then he prayed => فَدَعَا
prayed => فَدَعَا
Then they will call on them => فَدَعَوۡہُمۡ
And they will call upon them => فَدَعَوۡہُمۡ
and then crushed in => فَدُکَّتَا
So he caused them to fall => فَدَلّٰٮہُمَا
destroyed => فَدَمۡدَمَ
and We destroy it => فَدَمَّرۡنٰہَا
then We destroyed them => فَدَمَّرۡنٰہُمۡ
an expiation => فِدۡیَۃٌ
ransom => فِدۡیَۃٌ
So it tasted => فَذَاقَتۡ
So they tasted => فَذَاقُوۡا
Then they slaughtered her => فَذَبَحُوۡہَا
So leave Me => فَذَرۡنِیۡ
so leave them => فَذَرۡہُمۡ
so leave them alone => فَذَرۡہُمۡ
So leave her => فَذَرُوۡہَا
so let her alone => فَذَرُوۡہَا
So admonish => فَذَکِّرۡ
Admonish then => فَذَکِّرۡ
So go on reminding => فَذَکِّرۡ
Admonish => فَذَکِّرۡ
That => فَذٰلِکَ
That is the one => فَذٰلِکَ
Such is => فَذٰلِکُمُ
And this => فَذٰلِکُنَّ
So these => فَذٰنِکَ
Taste\, then => فَذُوۡقُوا
Then taste => فَذُوۡقُوا
taste therefore => فَذُوۡقُوا
Taste then => فَذُوۡقُوا
so now taste => فَذُوۡقُوا
So taste ye => فَذُوۡقُوا
Taste ye => فَذُوۡقُوا
taste it then => فَذُوۡقُوۡہُ
so that he looks upon it => فَرَاٰہُ
and see him => فَرَاٰہُ
and they saw it => فَرَاَوۡہُ
<em>and</em> sweet => فُرَاتٌ
sweet => فُرَاتٌ
sweet => فُرَاتًا
in fright => فِرَارًا
to flee away => فِرَارًا
flee => فِرَارًا
Then he went secretly => فَرَاغَ
Then he began suddenly => فَرَاغَ
he went => فَرَاغَ
the parting => فِرَاقُ
and your Lord => فَرَبُّکُمۡ
Fleeing => فَرَّتۡ
faeces => فَرۡثٍ
then <i>say your Prayer</i> on foot => فَرِجَالًا
is rent asunder => فُرِجَتۡ
returned => فَرَجَعَ
So We restored thee => فَرَجَعۡنٰکَ
Then they turned => فَرَجَعُوۡۤا
then a man => فَرَجُلٌ
her chastity => فَرۡجَہَا
her private parts => فَرۡجَہَا
rejoiced => فَرِحَ
he rejoices => فَرِحَ
they became exultant => فَرِحُوۡا
they rejoice => فَرِحُوۡا
they exulted => فَرِحُوۡا
rejoicing => فَرِحُوۡنَ
Jubilant => فَرِحِیۡنَ
all alone => فَرۡدًا
singly => فَرۡدًا
childless => فَرۡدًا
Thus did We restore him => فَرَدَدۡنٰہُ
one by one => فُرٰدٰی
you flee => فَرَرۡتُمۡ
carpets => فُرُشٍۭ
a bed => فِرٰشًا
We have spread out => فَرَشۡنٰہَا
made incumbent => فَرَضَ
have settled => فَرَضۡتُمۡ
We have enjoined => فَرَضۡنَا
exceeds all bounds => فُرُطًا
my remissness => فَرَّطتُّ
you failed in your duty => فَرَّطتُّمۡ
our neglecting => فَرَّطۡنَا
We have left out => فَرَّطۡنَا
Pharaoh => فِرۡعَوۡنَ
Pharaoh => فِرۡعَوۡنُ
became free => فٰرِغًا
thou art free => فَرَغۡتَ
part => فِرۡقٍ
fully => فَرۡقًا
a distinction => فُرۡقَانًا
section => فِرۡقَۃٍ
caused a division => فَرَّقۡتَ
We have revealed in pieces => فَرَقۡنٰہُ
split up => فَرَّقُوۡا
with great skill => فٰرِہِیۡنَ
flaws => فُرُوۡجٍ
their private parts => فُرُوۡجَہُمۡ
their chastity => فُرُوۡجَہُمۡ
their private parts => فُرُوۡجَہُنَّ
Then <em>for him </em>is comfort => فَرَوۡحٌ
strange => فَرِیًّا
a dowry => فَرِیۡضَۃً
<em>This</em> fixing <em>of portions</em> => فَرِیۡضَۃً
as fixed => فَرِیۡضَۃً
an ordinance => فَرِیۡضَۃً
a party => فَرِیۡقٌ
a section => فَرِیۡقٌ
some => فَرِیۡقٌ
a party => فَرِیۡقٍ
a section => فَرِیۡقًا
some => فَرِیۡقًا
a part => فَرِیۡقًا
any party => فَرِیۡقًا
they treated some => فَرِیۡقًا
a party => فَرِیۡقًا
two parties => فَرِیۡقَانِ
it increases their => فَزَادَتۡہُمۡ
it adds => فَزَادَتۡہُمۡ
has increased their => فَزَادَہُمُ
but this <i>only</i> increased => فَزَادَہُمۡ
and they <em>thus</em> increased => فَزَادُوۡہُمۡ
so add to him => فَزِدۡہُ
terror => فَزَعٍ
are relieved of fright => فُزِّعَ
they will be smitten with fear => فَزِعُوۡا
Then We shall separate => فَزَیَّلۡنَا
<em>appear</em> beautiful => فَزَیَّنَ
made <em>to appear</em> attractive => فَزَیَّنُوۡا
and evil => فَسَآءَ
and evil was => فَسَآءَ
it shall be an evil => فَسَآءَ
so I will ordain it => فَسَاَکۡتُبُہَا
for creating disorder => فَسَادٍ
create disorder => فَسَادًا
disorder => فَسَادًا
corruption => فَسَادًا
And he cast lots => فَسَاہَمَ
But glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
So glorify => فَسَبِّحۡ
Glorified then => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
So glorify => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
So Holy => فَسُبۡحٰنَ
do thou glorify Him => فَسَبِّحۡہُ
And thou wilt soon see => فَسَتُبۡصِرُ
So you will soon remember => فَسَتَذۡکُرُوۡنَ
and you will know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
Then will you know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
And you will soon know => فَسَتَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
and they <i>all</i> submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
and they <em>all </em>submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
and they all submitted => فَسَجَدُوۡۤا
but far away => فَسُحۡقًا
So We subjected => فَسَخَّرۡنَا
disobedience => فِسۡقٌ
profane => فِسۡقًا
then do We drive them => فَسُقۡنٰہُ
disobedient => فَسَقُوۡا
rebel => فَسَقُوۡۤا
disobedient => فٰسِقُوۡنَ
perfidious => فٰسِقُوۡنَ
were disobedient => فٰسِقُوۡنَ
wicked => فٰسِقُوۡنَ
rebellious => فٰسِقُوۡنَ
So he watered => فَسَقٰی
rebellious => فٰسِقِیۡنَ
disobedient => فٰسِقِیۡنَ
ask => فَسۡـَٔلِ
but ask => فَسۡـَٔلِ
So ask => فَسۡـَٔلۡ
Ask thou then => فَسۡـَٔلۡ
Then ‘Peace => فَسَلٰمٌ
salute => فَسَلِّمُوۡا
and ask him => فَسۡـَٔلۡہُ
so ask those => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡۤا
So ask => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡۤا
But ask them => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡہُمۡ
ask them => فَسۡـَٔلُوۡہُنَّ
We will facilitate for him => فَسَنُیَسِّرُہٗ
We will make easy for him => فَسَنُیَسِّرُہٗ
We shall soon => فَسَوۡفَ
soon => فَسَوۡفَ
then <em>let it be known that in his stead</em> => فَسَوۡفَ
but soon => فَسَوۡفَ
but you shall soon => فَسَوۡفَ
then => فَسَوۡفَ
we shall certainly => فَسَوۡفَ
and <I>the punishment of your rejection </I> => فَسَوۡفَ
But they will soon => فَسَوۡفَ
and soon => فَسَوۡفَ
shall be disobedience => فُسُوۡقٌۢ
and perfected => فَسَوّٰی
and perfects => فَسَوّٰی
then perfected thee => فَسَوّٰٮکَ
and made it perfect => فَسَوّٰٮہَا
and made it (destruction => فَسَوّٰٮہَا
and He perfected them => فَسَوّٰٮہُنَّ
but soon there will come to them => فَسَیَاۡتِیۡہِمۡ
He will surely give him => فَسَیُؤۡتِیۡہِ
He will gather them => فَسَیَحۡشُرُہُمۡ
So go about => فَسِیۡحُوۡا
He will surely admit them => فَسَیُدۡخِلُہُمۡ
so travel => فَسِیۡرُوۡا
will surely see => فَسَیَرَی
they will realize => فَسَیَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
and soon they will know => فَسَیَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
They will say => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
Then will they ask => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
Then they will say => فَسَیَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
They will then shake => فَسَیُنۡغِضُوۡنَ
They will surely continue to spend it => فَسَیُنۡفِقُوۡنَہَا
bind fast => فَشُدُّوا
And will drink => فَشٰرِبُوۡنَ
Drinking => فَشٰرِبُوۡنَ
you became lax => فَشِلۡتُمۡ
the evidence => فَشَہٰدَۃُ
then let fall => فَصَبَّ
He replied\, ‘Nay\, but your souls have embellished to you this thing. So <em>now </em>comely patience <I>is good for me</I> => فَصَبۡرٌ
then she has spoken the truth => فَصَدَقَتۡ
and has thus hindered them => فَصَدَّہُمۡ
and thus turned them away => فَصَدَّہُمۡ
and turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
and they turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
thus they turn <em>men </em>away => فَصَدُّوۡا
and turned away => فَصَرَفَ
and make them attached => فَصُرۡہُنَّ
and smote => فَصَکَّتۡ
So pray => فَصَلِّ
He has already explained => فَصَّلَ
departed => فَصَلَتِ
expounded in detail => فُصِّلَتۡ
have been expounded in detail => فُصِّلَتۡ
We have explained => فَصَّلۡنَا
which We have expounded => فَصَّلۡنٰہُ
We have explained => فَصَّلۡنٰہُ
and offers Prayers => فَصَلّٰی
should fast => فَصِیَامُ
shall fast => فَصِیَامُ
must fast => فَصِیَامُ
silver => فِضَّۃٍ
and she <em>too </em>was frightened => فَضَحِکَتۡ
smite => فَضَرۡبَ
Then there will be set up => فَضُرِبَ
So We sealed => فَضَرَبۡنَا
has favoured => فَضَّلَ
some good fortune => فَضۡلٌ
Gracious => فَضۡلٍ
bounty => فَضۡلٍ
is gracious => فَضۡلٍ
merit => فَضۡلٍ

grace => فَضۡلُ
the grace => فَضۡلُ
grace => فَضۡلِ
bounty => فَضۡلِ
grace => فَضۡلًا
bounty => فَضۡلًا
Through the grace => فَضۡلًا
exalted you => فَضَّلۡتُکُمۡ
He has exalted you => فَضَّلَکُمۡ
exalted us => فَضَّلَنَا
have We exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
We exalt => فَضَّلۡنَا
We have exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
We exalted => فَضَّلۡنَا
His grace => فَضۡلَہٗ
His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖ
given them of His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖ
His bounty => فَضۡلِہٖۤ
and have thus gone astray => فَضَلُّوۡا
Thus they have gone astray => فَضَلُّوۡا
visited => فَطَافَ
was prolonged => فَطَالَ
So a seal was set => فَطُبِعَ
created => فَطَرَ
He has created => فَطَرَ
the nature made => فِطۡرَتَ
created you => فَطَرَکُمۡ
created us => فَطَرَنَا
created me => فَطَرَنِیۡ
created me => فَطَرَنِیۡۤ
made them => فَطَرَہُنَّ
Then he began => فَطَفِقَ
divorce them => فَطَلِّقُوۡہُنَّ
We blinded => فَطَمَسۡنَاۤ
purify => فَطَہِّرۡ
flaw => فُطُوۡرٍ
rough => فَظًّا
will bow ... => فَظَلَّتۡ
then you would keep => فَظَلۡتُمۡ
but they unjustly rejected => فَظَلَمُوۡا
and they began => فَظَلُّوۡا
and he thought => فَظَنَّ
and realize => فَظَنُّوۡۤا
then when you retaliate => فَعَاقَبۡتُمۡ
then punish => فَعَاقِبُوۡا
bring about => فَعَّالٌ
Doer => فَعَّالٌ
But they rebelled => فَعَتَوۡا
then wondrous => فَعَجَبٌ
and He has given => فَعَجَّلَ
the same number => فَعِدَّۃٌ
then <em>know that </em>the prescribed period for them => فَعِدَّتُہُنَّ
then proportioned thee aright => فَعَدَلَکَ
and he knew them => فَعَرَفَہُمۡ
We strengthened => فَعَزَّزۡنَا
Maybe => فَعَسَی
Perhaps => فَعَسٰی
it may be => فَعَسٰۤی
maybe => فَعَسٰۤی
And they disobeyed => فَعَصَوۡا
disobeyed => فَعَصٰی
admonish them => فَعِظُوۡہُنَّ
but We pardoned => فَعَفَوۡنَا
and hamstrung => فَعَقَرَ
Then they hamstrung => فَعَقَرُوا
But they hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
and hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
have done => فَعَلَ
was done => فَعَلَ
did => فَعَلَ
has done => فَعَلَ
dealt => فَعَلَ
was done => فُعِلَ
the doing => فِعۡلَ
thou didst so => فَعَلۡتَ
hast done => فَعَلۡتَ
thou didst => فَعَلۡتَ
do thy deed => فَعۡلَتَکَ
you did => فَعَلۡتُمۡ
you have done => فَعَلۡتُمۡ
I did do it => فَعَلۡتُہَاۤ
I did it => فَعَلۡتُہٗ
and He knew => فَعَلِمَ
But He knew => فَعَلِمَ
Then they will know => فَعَلِمُوۡۤا
they do => فَعَلۡنَ
We dealt => فَعَلۡنَا
done this => فَعَلَہٗ
they commit => فَعَلُوۡا
have done => فَعَلُوۡا
had done => فَعَلُوۡا
which they committed => فَعَلُوۡہُ
they have done => فَعَلُوۡہُ
on me => فَعَلَیَّ
then it is your duty => فَعَلَیۡکُمُ
must do something => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
do something => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
to do => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
mean to </em>do<I> anything</I> => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
Who do => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
perform it => فٰعِلِیۡنَ
then in Him => فَعَلَیۡہِ
will bear => فَعَلَیۡہِ
suffer => فَعَلَیۡہِ
on him => فَعَلَیۡہِ
it is to his own harm => فَعَلَیۡہَا
against it => فَعَلَیۡہَا
does so to its detriment => فَعَلَیۡہَا
on them => فَعَلَیۡہِمۡ
they shall have => فَعَلَیۡہِنَّ
so they became blind => فَعَمُوۡا
has been rendered obscure => فَعُمِّیَتۡ
but with => فَعِنۡدَ
with => فَعِنۡدَ
So that there covered them => فَغَشّٰٮہَا
overwhelmed them => فَغَشِیَہُمۡ
So He forgave => فَغَفَرَ
So We forgave => فَغَفَرۡنَا
Thus were they vanquished => فَغُلِبُوۡا
and fetter him => فَغُلُّوۡہُ
so his life became miserable => فَغَوٰی
We opened => فَفَتَحۡنَاۤ
then We opened them => فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا
<i>should make</i> an expiation => فَفِدۡیَۃٌ
So I fled => فَفَرَرۡتُ
Flee ye therefore => فَفِرُّوۡۤا
some => فَفَرِیۡقًا
will be struck with terror => فَفَزِعَ
and he was afraid => فَفَزِعَ
and he disobeyed => فَفَسَقَ
but they transgress => فَفَسَقُوۡا
they will be => فَفِیۡ
in => فَفِیۡ
and said => فَقَالَ
and he said => فَقَالَ
replied => فَقَالَ
then he said => فَقَالَ
said => فَقَالَ
he said => فَقَالَ
who said => فَقَالَ
Yet he says => فَقَالَ
say => فَقَالَ
Saying => فَقَالَ
so she said => فَقَالَتۡ
They will say => فَقَالُوۡا
and they say => فَقَالُوۡا
And they said => فَقَالُوۡا
and said => فَقَالُوۡا
But they said => فَقَالُوۡا
they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
and said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
And they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
but they said => فَقَالُوۡۤا
partly => فَقَبَضۡتُ
Fight\, therefore => فَقٰتِلۡ
Ruin seize him => فَقُتِلَ
fight => فَقٰتِلَاۤ
so he killed him => فَقَتَلَہٗ
he slew him => فَقَتَلَہٗ
fight the party => فَقٰتِلُوا
then fight => فَقٰتِلُوۡۤا
has surely => فَقَدِ

Now have => فَقَدۡ

thereof => فَقَدۡ
he indeed => فَقَدۡ
and straitens => فَقَدَرَ
Thus did We measure => فَقَدَرۡنَا
ordained for it => فَقَدَّرَہٗ
and proportions him => فَقَدَّرَہٗ
give => فَقَدِّمُوۡا
we threw them => فَقَذَفۡنٰہَا
poor => فُقَرَآءَ
And he had read it => فَقَرَاَہٗ
he placed it => فَقَرَّبَہٗۤ
were hardened => فَقَسَتۡ
So He completed them => فَقَضٰٮہُنَّ
so that it tears => فَقَطَّعَ

And say => فَقُلۡ
And I said => فَقُلۡتُ
and We said => فَقُلۡنَا
So We said => فَقُلۡنَا
Then We said => فَقُلۡنَا
and We shall say => فَقُلۡنَا
Little => فَقَلِیۡلًا
save us\, then => فَقِنَا
and say => فَقُوۡلَاۤ
But speak => فَقُوۡلَا
then say => فَقُوۡلُوا
and say => فَقُوۡلُوا
say => فَقُوۡلِیۡۤ
poor => فَقِیۡرٌ
need => فَقِیۡرٌ
poor => فَقِیۡرًا
the freein => فَکُّ
it shall be as if => فَکَاَنَّمَاۤ
it shall be as if => فَکَاَنَّمَا
write it for them => فَکَاتِبُوۡہُمۡ
and he became => فَکَانَ
so he was => فَکَانَ
were => فَکَانَ
it belonged to => فَکَانَ
and => فَکَانَ
and was => فَکَانَ
So that he became => فَکَانَ
it belonged to => فَکَانَتۡ
and becomes => فَکَانَتۡ
They shall <em>all </em>become => فَکَانَتۡ
and shall become => فَکَانَتۡ
but they => فَکَانُوۡا
and they were => فَکَانُوۡا
and it was => فَکَانُوۡا
they became => فَکَانُوۡا
they are => فَکَانُوۡا
shall be thrown down on => فَکُبَّتۡ
magnify => فَکَبِّرۡ
Then will they be thrown headlong => فَکُبۡکِبُوۡا
and He multiplied you => فَکَثَّرَکُمۡ
but he rejected => فَکَذَّبَ
then she has lied => فَکَذَبَتۡ
but we treated <em>him </em>as a liar => فَکَذَّبۡنَا
aye\, they rejected => فَکَذَّبُوۡا
But they accused him of falsehood => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
But they rejected him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
but they treated him as a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they rejected him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they declared him to be a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
But they called him a liar => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they called them liars => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
and they rejected them both => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
likewise => فَکَذٰلِکَ
reflected => فَکَّرَ
Certainly you would loathe it => فَکَرِہۡتُمُوۡہُ
then We clothed => فَکَسَوۡنَا
and removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا
now We have removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا
but He withheld => فَکَفَّ
but it denied => فَکَفَرَتۡ
The expiation for this => فَکَفّٰرَتُہٗۤ
but they disbelieved => فَکَفَرُوۡا
So they disbelieved => فَکَفَرُوۡا
So each one <em>of them </em> => فَکُلًّا
and eat => فَکُلَا
and eat => فَکُلُوۡا
So eat => فَکُلُوۡا
Eat\, then => فَکُلُوۡا
Then eat ye => فَکُلُوۡا
eat => فَکُلُوۡا
then enjoy it => فَکُلُوۡہُ
So eat => فَکُلِیۡ
and you => فَکُنۡتُمۡ
but you used => فَکُنۡتُمۡ
fruits => فٰکِہَۃٌ
fruit => فٰکِہَۃٌ
fruit => فٰکِہَۃٍ

took delight => فٰکِہِیۡنَ
Enjoying => فٰکِہِیۡنَ
use it against Me => فَکِیۡدُوۡنِ
So devise plans against me => فَکِیۡدُوۡنِیۡ
How <em>will they fare</em> => فَکَیۡفَ
Then how => فَکَیۡفَ
How then => فَکَیۡفَ
and how => فَکَیۡفَ
and how <em>terrible </em> => فَکَیۡفَ
So how => فَکَیۡفَ
But how => فَکَیۡفَ
How => فَکَیۡفَ
it shall be no => فَلَاۤ
then => فَلَاۤ
there will be no => فَلَاۤ
Nay => فَلَاۤ
But nay => فَلَاۤ
I will therefore surely cut off => فَلَاُقَطِّعَنَّ
then his mother shall have => فَلِاُمِّہِ
then his mother => فَلِاُمِّہِ
for themselves => فَلِاَنۡفُسِہِمۡ
no => فَلَا
do not => فَلَا
not therefore => فَلَا
then she is not => فَلَا
then it shall be no => فَلَا
none => فَلَا
so => فَلَا
But no => فَلَا
it shall be no => فَلَا
not => فَلَا
<em>shall come </em> => فَلَا
there is none => فَلَا
<em>shall come </em>no => فَلَا
And none => فَلَا
make not => فَلَا
there can be no => فَلَا
So let not => فَلَا
they cannot => فَلَا
therefore => فَلَا
then there shall be no => فَلَا
there is no => فَلَا
not then => فَلَا
never => فَلَا
So be not => فَلَا
will have no => فَلَا
but => فَلَا
so that no => فَلَا
will not => فَلَا
and cannot => فَلَا
not\, therefore => فَلَا
there shall be no => فَلَا
so never => فَلَا
it does not => فَلَا
let not => فَلَا
and not => فَلَا
Then there will be no => فَلَا
and you shall not => فَلَا
has no => فَلَا
such a one => فُلَانًا
Evil indeed => فَلَبِئۡسَ
so he remained => فَلَبِثَ
and he dwelt => فَلَبِثَ
thou didst tarry => فَلَبِثۡتَ
so that thou shouldst know them => فَلَعَرَفۡتَہُمۡ
thou art now perhaps => فَلَعَلَّکَ
So haply thou => فَلَعَلَّکَ
curse => فَلَعۡنَۃُ
then they would have surely fought you => فَلَقٰتَلُوۡکُمۡ
orbit => فَلَکٍ
an orbit => فَلَکٍ
then each => فَلِکُلِّ
then you shall have => فَلَکُمُ
then you shall => فَلَکُمۡ
you shall have => فَلَکُمۡ
then the male shall have => فَلِلذَّکَرِ
Allah’s => فَلِلّٰہِ

to Allah belong => فَلِلّٰہِ
for Allah => فَلِلّٰہِ

but => فَلَمۡ
and shall not => فَلَمۡ
but they will not => فَلَمۡ
So => فَلَمۡ
has only => فَلَمۡ
Why\, then => فَلِمَ
Why then => فَلِمَ
and when => فَلَمَّاۤ
But when => فَلَمَّاۤ
So\, when => فَلَمَّاۤ
yet when => فَلَمَّا
But when => فَلَمَّا
And when => فَلَمَّا
but since => فَلَمَّا
Then\, when => فَلَمَّا
So when => فَلَمَّا
So\, when => فَلَمَّا
And\, when => فَلَمَّا
when Zaid had => فَلَمَّا
and they had felt it => فَلَمَسُوۡہُ
shall not => فَلَنۡ
cannot => فَلَنۡ
no => فَلَنۡ
not => فَلَنۡ
never => فَلَنۡ
I will\, therefore => فَلَنۡ
never => فَلَنۡ
But we shall assuredly bring thee => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّکَ
we shall surely come to them => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّہُمۡ
We will surely grant him => فَلَنُحۡیِیَنَّہٗ
And We will certainly question => فَلَنَسۡـَٔلَنَّ
and what an excellent => فَلَنِعۡمَ
it is for his own good => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
for the benefit of his own soul => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
it is for his own soul => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
does it for his own soul => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
Then will We certainly relate => فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ
Then We will surely tell => فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ
surely\, then\, will We make thee turn => فَلَنُوَلِّیَنَّکَ
His => فَلَہُ
she shall have => فَلَہَا
then she shall have => فَلَہَا
it will <em>only go </em>against them => فَلَہَا
shall have => فَلَہُمۡ
have => فَلَہُمۡ
they will have => فَلَہُمۡ
for them\, therefore => فَلَہُمۡ
for them => فَلَہُمۡ
so for them => فَلَہُمۡ
then they shall have => فَلَہُمَا
then they shall have => فَلَہُنَّ
for him there => فَلَہٗ
shall have => فَلَہٗ
he will have => فَلَہٗ
shall have => فَلَہٗۤ
If => فَلَوۡ
Would => فَلَوۡ
And why have not => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
Why\, then => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
and had it not been => فَلَوۡلَا
Why\, then\, does not => فَلَوۡلَا
Why\, then => فَلَوۡلَا
and let him bring you => فَلۡیَاۡتِکُمۡ
then bring us => فَلۡیَاۡتِنَا
Let them\, then\, bring forth => فَلۡیَاۡتُوۡا
Let them\, then\, produce => فَلۡیَاۡتُوۡا
let him eat <em>thereof</em> => فَلۡیَاۡکُلۡ
and they will cut => فَلَیُبَتِّکُنَّ
Let them\, therefore\, fear => فَلۡیَتَّقُوا
aspire => فَلۡیَتَنَافَسِ
put their trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
So let => فَلۡیَحۡذَرِ
Then let him call => فَلۡیَدۡعُ
So let them taste it => فَلۡیَذُوۡقُوۡہُ
So let them ascend => فَلۡیَرۡتَقُوۡا
is not => فَلَیۡسَ
no => فَلَیۡسَ
it shall be no => فَلَیۡسَ
there is no => فَلَیۡسَ
cannot => فَلَیۡسَ
No friend\, therefore => فَلَیۡسَ
So they should hearken => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡا
and let them answer => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡا
they <em>too</em> should ask permission => فَلۡیَسۡتَـٔۡذِنُوۡا
let him abstain => فَلۡیَسۡتَعۡفِفۡ
come forward and pray => فَلۡیُصَلُّوۡا
let him fast therein => فَلۡیَصُمۡہُ
They must laugh => فَلۡیَضۡحَکُوۡا
They should worship => فَلۡیَعۡبُدُوۡا
do => فَلۡیَعۡمَلۡ
and they will alter => فَلَیُغَیِّرُنَّ
therefore\, let them rejoice => فَلۡیَفۡرَحُوۡا
Let those then fight => فَلۡیُقٰتِلۡ
so let him write => فَلۡیَکۡتُبۡ
let them => فَلۡیَکُوۡنُوۡا
cast it => فَلۡیُلۡقِہِ
does give => فَلۡیَمۡدُدۡ
and let him see => فَلۡیَنۡظُرۡ
Then let him see => فَلۡیَنۡظُرۡ
How great => فَمَاۤ

But that => فَمَاۤ
But => فَمَاۤ
no => فَمَاۤ
neither => فَمَاۤ

There is\, therefore\, no => فَمَا
then <i>make</i> whatever offering => فَمَا
not => فَمَا
And for => فَمَا
What has => فَمَا
But that => فَمَا
So => فَمَا
then no => فَمَا
But => فَمَا

So\, as long as => فَمَا

I have not => فَمَا

What then => فَمَا
What => فَمَا
only => فَمَا
And what => فَمَا
there is no => فَمَا
And no => فَمَا

And => فَمَا
no => فَمَا
So what is => فَمَا
none => فَمَا
Now what => فَمَا

So what => فَمَا
Then what => فَمَا
Now what => فَمَاذَا
So wha => فَمَاذَا
But what is the matter with => فَمَالِ

a temporary enjoyment => فَمَتٰعُ
only a temporary provision => فَمَتٰعُ
so We gave them provision => فَمَتَّعۡنٰہُمۡ
So make some provision for them => فَمَتِّعُوۡہُنَّ
His case therefore => فَمَثَلُہٗ
We have made dark => فَمَحَوۡنَاۤ

Whoso\, therefore => فَمَنِ
then whoso => فَمَنِ
and whosoever => فَمَنِ
But those who => فَمَنِ

It is\, therefore => فَمَنۡ
But if => فَمَنۡ
But whoso => فَمَنۡ

Who is then => فَمَنۡ
Who\, then => فَمَنۡ
Who is\, then => فَمَنۡ
Who => فَمَنۡ

it is from => فَمِنَ
it will be of => فَمِنۡ

of which => فَمِنۡہُ
some of them => فَمِنۡہَا
of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
And of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
some of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
Then among them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
of them were those => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
then some of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
So some of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
of them => فَمِنۡہُمۡ
So give time => فَمَہِّلِ
They cried out <em>for help</em> => فَنَادَوۡا
But they called => فَنَادَوۡا
and he cried out => فَنَادٰی
and proclaimed => فَنَادٰی
Then he called her => فَنَادٰٮہَا
and wait to see => فَنَاظِرَۃٌۢ
I cast away => فَنَبَذۡتُہَا
Then We cast him => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُ
and cast them => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُمۡ
and threw them => فَنَبَذۡنٰہُمۡ
But they threw it away => فَنَبَذُوۡہُ
we would disown => فَنَتَبَرَّاَ
that we might have followed => فَنَتَّبِعَ
and invoke => فَنَجۡعَل
then was saved => فَنُجِّیَ
We delivered thee => فَنَجَّیۡنٰکَ
so We saved him => فَنَجَّیۡنٰہُ
and delivered him => فَنَجَّیۡنٰہُ
produce => فَنُخۡرِجُ
But We leave => فَنَذَرُ
Then <em>for him will be </em>an entertainment => فَنُزُلٌ
but they too have forgotten => فَنَسُوۡا
So he gave up => فَنَسِیَ
but he forgot => فَنَسِیَ
and thou didst disregard them => فَنَسِیۡتَہَا
so He has neglected them => فَنَسِیَہُمۡ
Then he cast => فَنَظَرَ
we continue => فَنَظَلُّ
how excellent => فَنِعۡمَ
and <em>how </em>excellently => فَنِعۡمَ
excellently => فَنِعۡمَ
so that we might do => فَنَعۡمَلَ
so We breathed => فَنَفَخۡنَا
profited them => فَنَفَعَہَاۤ
they went => فَنَقَّبُوۡا
that we might be => فَنَکُوۡنَ
We will inform you => فَنُنَبِّئُکُمۡ
We shall tell them => فَنُنَبِّئُہُمۡ
Grant => فَہَبۡ

We gave them guidance => فَہَدَیۡنٰہُمۡ

then are they surely guided => فَقَدِ اہۡتَدَوۡا
then they are only => فَاِنَّمَا ہُمۡ فِیۡ
and Allah will surely suffice thee against them => فَسَیَکۡفِیۡکَہُمُ اللّٰہُ
and Him alone do we worship => وَّنَحۡنُ لَہٗ عٰبِدُوۡنَ
and to Him alone we => وَّنَحۡنُ لَہٗ

and the male <em>she was thinking of</em> was not like the female <em> => وَلَیۡسَ الذَّکَرُ کَالۡاُنۡثٰی

the believers => الَّذِیۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡا
And obey none => وَلَا تُؤۡمِنُوۡۤا
We are not liable to blame => لَیۡسَ عَلَیۡنَا
take a paltry price in exchange for <em>their</em> covenant with Allah and their oaths => یَشۡتَرُوۡنَ بِعَہۡدِ اللّٰہِ وَاَیۡمٰنِہِمۡ ثَمَنًا
and Allah will neither speak to them => وَلَا یُکَلِّمُہُمُ اللّٰہُ
while it is not => وَمَا ہُوَ
while it is not => وَمَا ہُوَ مِنۡ
not to Allah => مِنۡ دُوۡنِ اللّٰہِ
Do they seek a religion other than => اَفَغَیۡرَ دِیۡنِ

there shall not be accepted => فَلَنۡ یُّقۡبَلَ
an earthful => مِّلۡءُ الۡاَرۡضِ

then it => ذٰلِکَ فَاُولٰٓئِکَ
that Allah is surely => فَاِنَّ اللّٰہَ
and His Messenger is present among you => وَفِیۡکُمۡ رَسُوۡلُہٗ
is indeed guided => فَقَدۡ ہُدِیَ

faces will be black => اسۡوَدَّتۡ وُجُوۡہُہُمۡ
those whose faces will be white => الَّذِیۡنَ ابۡیَضَّتۡ وُجُوۡہُہُمۡ

shall all affairs be returned => تُرۡجَعُ الۡاُمُوۡرُ
it would have surely been better => لَکَانَ خَیۡرًا
They cannot harm you => لَنۡ یَّضُرُّوۡکُمۡ

Will it not suffice you => اَلَنۡ یَّکۡفِیَکُمۡ
and that your hearts might be at rest => وَلِتَطۡمَئِنَّ قُلُوۡبُکُمۡ

by Allah’s leave => بِاِذۡنِ اللّٰہِ
And they uttered not a word => وَمَا کَانَ قَوۡلَہُمۡ
So Allah gave them => فَاٰتٰٮہُمُ اللّٰہُ
And Allah had surely made good to you => وَلَقَدۡ صَدَقَکُمُ اللّٰہُ
and looked not back => وَلَا تَلۡوٗنَ
that you might not grieve => لِّکَیۡلَا تَحۡزَنُوۡا

when the two hosts met => الۡتَقَی الۡجَمۡعَانِ
they would not have died => مَا مَاتُوۡا
that Allah may make => لِیَجۡعَلَ اللّٰہُ
Allah help you => یَّنۡصُرۡکُمُ اللّٰہُ
then\, let the believers put their trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ الۡمُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
And it is not possible => وَمَا کَانَ
shall every soul be fully paid => تُوَفّٰی کُلُّ نَفۡسٍ
shall not be wronged => لَا یُظۡلَمُوۡنَ
before that => مِنۡ قَبۡلُ
and you had inflicted => قَدۡ اَصَبۡتُمۡ

was by Allah’s command => فَبِاِذۡنِ اللّٰہِ
they would not have been slain => مَا قُتِلُوۡا
Think not of those => تَحۡسَبَنَّ الَّذِیۡنَ
which Allah has given them => اٰتٰٮہُمُ اللّٰہُ

shall have a great reward => اَجۡرٌ عَظِیۡمٌ
It is Satan who only frightens => اِنَّمَا ذٰلِکُمُ الشَّیۡطٰنُ یُخَوِّفُ

Powerful over everything => عَلٰی کُلِّ شَیۡءٍ مُّقِیۡتًا
greet ye with a better prayer or <em>at least</em> return it => فَحَیُّوۡا بِاَحۡسَنَ مِنۡہَاۤ اَوۡ رُدُّوۡہَاۤ
Surely\, Allah takes account of all things => اِنَّ اللّٰہَ کَانَ عَلٰی کُلِّ شَیۡءٍ حَسِیۡبًا
Allah is He beside Whom there is none worthy of worship => اَللّٰہُ لَاۤ اِلٰہَ اِلَّا ہُوَ

Allah causes to perish => یُّضۡلِلِ اللّٰہُ
thou shalt not find a way => فَلَنۡ تَجِدَ لَہٗ سَبِیۡلًا
They wish that => وَدُّوۡا لَوۡ
Take not => فَلَا تَتَّخِذُوۡا
therefore\, friends from among them => مِنۡہُمۡ اَوۡلِیَآءَ
emigrate in the way of Allah => فِیۡ سَبِیۡلِ اللّٰہِ

friend nor helper from among them => مِنۡہُمۡ وَلِیًّا وَّلَا نَصِیۡرًا
while their hearts shrink => حَصِرَتۡ صُدُوۡرُہُمۡ

and fight you not => فَلَمۡ یُقٰتِلُوۡکُمۡ
and make you an offer => وَاَلۡقَوۡا اِلَیۡکُمُ
then <em>remember that</em> Allah has allowed you no way <em>of aggression</em> against them => فَمَا جَعَلَ اللّٰہُ لَکُمۡ عَلَیۡہِمۡ سَبِیۡلًا
Whenever they are made to revert => کُلَّ مَا رُدُّوۡۤا

efface their sins => یَّعۡفُوَ عَنۡہُمۡ
for Allah is the Effacer of sins\, <em>and is</em> Most Forgiving => وَکَانَ اللّٰہُ عَفُوًّا غَفُوۡرًا

those who disbelieve may give you trouble => یَّفۡتِنَکُمُ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡۤا
an open enemy to you => لَکُمۡ عَدُوًّا مُّبِیۡنًا
the Prayer for them => لَہُمُ الصَّلٰوۃَ
let a party of them stand => فَلۡتَقُمۡ طَآئِفَۃٌ مِّنۡہُمۡ
and let another party\, who have => وَلۡتَاۡتِ طَآئِفَۃٌ اُخۡرٰی

an humiliating punishment for the disbelievers => لِلۡکٰفِرِیۡنَ عَذَابًا مُّہِیۡنًا
And when you have finished the Prayer => فَاِذَا قَضَیۡتُمُ الصَّلٰوۃَ

and <em>lying</em> on your sides => وَّعَلٰی جُنُوۡبِکُمۡ

And they ruin none => وَمَا یُضِلُّوۡنَ

good works => مِنَ الصّٰلِحٰتِ
And Allah took => وَاتَّخَذَ اللّٰہُ
And people are prone to => وَاُحۡضِرَتِ الۡاَنۡفُسُ

But incline not wholly => فَلَا تَمِیۡلُوۡا کُلَّ الۡمَیۡلِ
out of => کُلًّا مِّنۡ
And We have assuredly commanded => وَلَقَدۡ وَصَّیۡنَا
Therefore follow not => فَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا

has surely strayed => ضَلَّ ضَلٰلًۢا
Give to the hypocrites the tidings => بَشِّرِ الۡمُنٰفِقِیۡنَ
being denied => یُکۡفَرُ بِہَا
Were we not => اَلَمۡ نَکُنۡ
Did we not get the better of you => اَلَمۡ نَسۡتَحۡوِذۡ
and Allah will not grant => وَلَنۡ یَّجۡعَلَ اللّٰہُ
and they remember => وَلَا یَذۡکُرُوۡنَ
thou shalt not find => فَلَنۡ تَجِدَ
and thou shalt find no => وَلَنۡ تَجِدَ
And Allah will soon bestow => وَسَوۡفَ یُؤۡتِ اللّٰہُ
should Allah punish you => یَفۡعَلُ اللّٰہُ بِعَذَابِکُمۡ
ou are thankful and <em>if</em> you believe => عَلِیۡمًا
the uttering of unseemly speech in public => الۡجَہۡرَ بِالسُّوۡٓءِ مِنَ الۡقَوۡلِ
an evil => عَنۡ سُوۡٓءٍ

disbelievers => ہُمُ الۡکٰفِرُوۡنَ
and make no distinction => وَلَمۡ یُفَرِّقُوۡا
ask thee to cause a Book to descend => اَنۡ تُنَزِّلَ عَلَیۡہِمۡ کِتٰبًا
Then a destructive punishment overtook them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ الصّٰعِقَۃُ
had come to them => مَا جَآءَتۡہُمُ
so they believe not => فَلَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
We did kill => اِنَّا قَتَلۡنَا
whereas they slew him not => وَمَا قَتَلُوۡہُ
he was made to appear to them like => شُبِّہَ لَہُمۡ
knowledge => مِنۡ عِلۡمٍ
and they did not convert this <em>conjecture</em> into => وَمَا قَتَلُوۡہُ
the Jews => الَّذِیۡنَ ہَادُوۡا
after him => مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِہٖ
already => مِنۡ قَبۡلُ
and Allah spoke => وَکَلَّمَ اللّٰہُ

plea against Allah => عَلَی اللّٰہِ حُجَّۃٌۢ
have certainly strayed => ضَلُّوۡا ضَلٰلًۢا
easy for Allah => عَلَی اللّٰہِ یَسِیۡرًا
O People of the Book => یٰۤاَہۡلَ الۡکِتٰبِ
He should have => یَّکُوۡنَ لَہٗ
Surely\, the Messiah will never => لَّنۡ یَّسۡتَنۡکِفَ الۡمَسِیۡحُ
nor will the angels => وَلَا الۡمَلٰٓئِکَۃُ
He will give them their rewards in full => فَیُوَفِّیۡہِمۡ اُجُوۡرَہُمۡ
And they shall find for themselves beside Allah no => وَّلَا یَجِدُوۡنَ لَہُمۡ مِّنۡ دُوۡنِ اللّٰہِ
clear light => نُوۡرًا مُّبِیۡنًا
she has => یَکُنۡ لَّہَا
and Allah knows all things well => وَاللّٰہُ بِکُلِّ شَیۡءٍ عَلِیۡمٌۢ
but help not one another => وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوۡا
I perfected your religion for you => اَکۡمَلۡتُ لَکُمۡ دِیۡنَکُمۡ
of the Book => اُوۡتُوا الۡکِتٰبَ
and in the Hereafter he => وَہُوَ فِی الۡاٰخِرَۃِ
and you find not => فَلَمۡ تَجِدُوۡا
Allah’s favour => نِعۡمَۃَ اللّٰہِ
to act otherwise than with justice => اَلَّا تَعۡدِلُوۡا
their hands against you => اِلَیۡکُمۡ اَیۡدِیَہُمۡ
And on Allah => وَعَلَی اللّٰہِ
twelve => اثۡنَیۡ عَشَرَ
And Allah said => وَّقَالَ اللّٰہُ
the right path => سَوَآءَ السَّبِیۡلِ
And thou wilt not cease => وَلَا تَزَالُ
And Allah will soon let them know => وَسَوۡفَ یُنَبِّئُہُمُ اللّٰہُ
and a clear Book => وَّکِتٰبٌ مُّبِیۡنٌ
The Jews and the Christians say => وَقَالَتِ الۡیَہُوۡدُ وَالنَّصٰرٰی
the Holy Land => الۡاَرۡضَ الۡمُقَدَّسَۃَ
turn back => تَرۡتَدُّوۡا عَلٰۤی اَدۡبَارِکُمۡ
there is in that <em>land</em> a haughty and powerful people => قَوۡمًا جَبَّارِیۡنَ
so long as they => اَبَدًا مَّا دَامُوۡا
therefore make Thou a distinction between us => فَافۡرُقۡ بَیۡنَنَا وَبَیۡنَ
the rebellious people => الۡقَوۡمِ الۡفٰسِقِیۡنَ
So grieve not => فَلَا تَاۡسَ
and was not accepted => وَلَمۡ یُتَقَبَّلۡ
I am not going to stretch out => مَاۤ اَنَا۠ بِبَاسِطٍ
But his mind induced him => فَطَوَّعَتۡ لَہٗ نَفۡسُہٗ
Then Allah sent => فَبَعَثَ اللّٰہُ
to be => اَنۡ اَکُوۡنَ
regretful => مِنَ النّٰدِمِیۡنَ
On account of => مِنۡ اَجۡلِ
yet even => ثُمَّ اِنَّ
and in the Hereafter they shall have => وَّلَہُمۡ فِی الۡاٰخِرَۃِ
in your power => اَنۡ تَقۡدِرُوۡا
if those who disbelieve had => الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا لَوۡ اَنَّ لَہُمۡ
it would not be accepted => مَا تُقُبِّلَ
but they will not => وَمَا ہُمۡ
a lasting punishment => عَذَابٌ مُّقِیۡمٌ
then will Allah surely => فَاِنَّ اللّٰہَ
turn to him in mercy => یَتُوۡبُ عَلَیۡہِ
Dost thou not know => اَلَمۡ تَعۡلَمۡ
but their hearts believe not => وَلَمۡ تُؤۡمِنۡ قُلُوۡبُہُمۡ
for <em>conveying it to</em> another people => لِقَوۡمٍ اٰخَرِیۡنَ
thou shalt not avail => فَلَنۡ تَمۡلِکَ
has not been pleased => لَمۡ یُرِدِ
and certainly they will not believe => وَمَاۤ اُولٰٓئِکَ بِالۡمُؤۡمِنِیۡنَ
Therefore fear not => فَلَا تَخۡشَوُا
and barter not => وَلَا تَشۡتَرُوۡا
And therein We prescribed for them => وَکَتَبۡنَا عَلَیۡہِمۡ فِیۡہَاۤ
before him => بَیۡنَ یَدَیۡہِ
before it => بَیۡنَ یَدَیۡہِ
And let the People of the Gospel judge => وَلۡیَحۡکُمۡ اَہۡلُ الۡاِنۡجِیۡلِ
and follow not their evil inclinations => وَلَا تَتَّبِعۡ اَہۡوَآءَہُمۡ
shall you all return => مَرۡجِعُکُمۡ جَمِیۡعًا
which Allah has revealed => اَنۡزَلَ اللّٰہُ
Do they then seek the judgment of <em>the days of</em> Ignorance => اَفَحُکۡمَ الۡجٰہِلِیَّۃِ یَبۡغُوۡنَ
will bring about => اَنۡ یَّاۡتِیَ
And those who believe will say => وَیَقُوۡلُ الَّذِیۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡۤا
with their most solemn oaths => جَہۡدَ اَیۡمٰنِہِمۡ
they were surely with you => اِنَّہُمۡ لَمَعَکُمۡ
and will not fear => وَلَا یَخَافُوۡنَ
Allah’s grace => فَضۡلُ اللّٰہِ
because => اِلَّاۤ اَنۡ
previously => مِنۡ قَبۡلُ
and on whom His wrath has fallen => وَغَضِبَ عَلَیۡہِ
and of whom He has made => وَجَعَلَ مِنۡہُمُ
and go out => وَہُمۡ قَدۡ خَرَجُوۡا
And if => وَلَوۡ اَنَّ
thou hast not conveyed => فَمَا بَلَّغۡتَ
whereas the Messiah <em>himself </em>said => وَقَالَ الۡمَسِیۡحُ
forbidden => فَقَدۡ حَرَّمَ
and the Fire will be his resort => وَمَاۡوٰٮہُ النَّارُ
And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers => وَمَا لِلظّٰلِمِیۡنَ مِنۡ اَنۡصَارٍ
Allah => اِنَّ اللّٰہَ
One God => اِلٰہٌ وّٰحِدٌ
they do not desist => یَنۡتَہُوۡا عَمَّا
Will they not then turn => اَفَلَا یَتُوۡبُوۡنَ
The Messiah => مَّا الۡمَسِیۡحُ
before him => مِنۡ قَبۡلِہِ
We explain the Signs for their good => نُبَیِّنُ لَہُمُ الۡاٰیٰتِ
beside => مِنۡ دُوۡنِ
has no power => لَا یَمۡلِکُ
And it is Allah Who => وَاللّٰہُ ہُوَ
exceed not the limits in <em>the matter of</em> your religion unjustly => لَا تَغۡلُوۡا فِیۡ دِیۡنِکُمۡ غَیۡرَ الۡحَقِّ
who went astray => قَدۡ ضَلُّوۡا
and caused many to go astray => وَاَضَلُّوۡا کَثِیۡرًا
they would not have taken them as <em>their</em> => مَا اتَّخَذُوۡہُمۡ
because of the truth which they have recognized => مِمَّا عَرَفُوۡا مِنَ الۡحَقِّ
and in the truth which has come to us => وَمَا جَآءَنَا مِنَ الۡحَقِّ
the righteous people => الۡقَوۡمِ الصّٰلِحِیۡنَ
So Allah rewarded them => فَاَثٰبَہُمُ اللّٰہُ
make not unlawful => لَا تُحَرِّمُوۡا
Allah => اللّٰہَ الَّذِیۡۤ
for the oaths which you take in earnest => بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ الۡاَیۡمٰنَ

the game => مِّنَ الصَّیۡدِ
which your hands and your lances can reach => تَنَالُہٗۤ اَیۡدِیۡکُمۡ وَرِمَاحُکُمۡ

Allah has not ordained => مَا جَعَلَ اللّٰہُ
even though => اَوَلَوۡ کَانَ

will you all return => مَرۡجِعُکُمۡ جَمِیۡعًا
not from among you => مِنۡ غَیۡرِکُمۡ

<I> saying</I>\, ‘We take not in exchange => لَا نَشۡتَرِیۡ

and we have not been unfair <em>in any way</em> => وَمَا اعۡتَدَیۡنَاۤ
the disobedient people => الۡقَوۡمَ الۡفٰسِقِیۡنَ
and those who disbelieved from among them said => فَقَالَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا مِنۡہُمۡ
the disciples <em>of Jesus </em> => اِلَی الۡحَوَارِیّٖنَ
and that our hearts be at rest => وَتَطۡمَئِنَّ قُلُوۡبُنَا
thou hast spoken truth to us => قَدۡ صَدَقۡتَنَا

Thou wouldst have surely known it => الۡغُیُوۡبِ
and I know not => وَلَاۤ اَعۡلَمُ
Thou didst command me => اَمَرۡتَنِیۡ بِہٖۤ
Thou hast been => کُنۡتَ اَنۡتَ
Thou surely => فَاِنَّکَ اَنۡتَ
the great triumph => الۡفَوۡزُ الۡعَظِیۡمُ
And there comes not to them => وَمَا تَاۡتِیۡہِمۡ
any Sign => مِّنۡ اٰیَۃٍ

a generation => مِّنۡ قَرۡنٍ
beneath them => مِنۡ تَحۡتِہِمۡ
after them => مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِہِمۡ
the disbelievers would have surely said => لَقَالَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡۤا
they would not have been granted a respite => لَا یُنۡظَرُوۡنَ
but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed => فَحَاقَ بِالَّذِیۡنَ سَخِرُوۡا مِنۡہُمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا بِہٖ یَسۡتَہۡزِءُوۡنَ
Who feeds => وَہُوَ یُطۡعِمُ

an awful day. => یَوۡمٍ عَظِیۡمٍ
He has power to do all that He wills => عَلٰی کُلِّ شَیۡءٍ قَدِیۡرٌ
And this Qur’an has been revealed to me => وَاُوۡحِیَ اِلَیَّ ہٰذَا الۡقُرۡاٰنُ
so that with it I may warn you => لِاُنۡذِرَکُمۡ بِہٖ

And that which they fabricated has failed them => وَضَلَّ عَنۡہُمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا یَفۡتَرُوۡنَ
they should not understand => اَنۡ یَّفۡقَہُوۡہُ
and deafness in their ears => وَفِیۡۤ اٰذَانِہِمۡ وَقۡرًا
they would not believe => لَّا یُؤۡمِنُوۡا
And they ruin none => وَاِنۡ یُّہۡلِکُوۡنَ
And<I> then </I>we would not treat the Signs of our Lord as lies => وَلَا نُکَذِّبَ بِاٰیٰتِ رَبِّنَا

There is nothing except <em>this </em>our present life => ہِیَ اِلَّا حَیَاتُنَا الدُّنۡیَا

you disbelieved => کُنۡتُمۡ تَکۡفُرُوۡنَ
Those indeed are the losers who => قَدۡ خَسِرَ الَّذِیۡنَ
And worldly life is nothing => وَمَا الۡحَیٰوۃُ الدُّنۡیَاۤ
And Messengers indeed have been rejected => وَلَقَدۡ کُذِّبَتۡ رُسُلٌ

And there have already come to thee => وَلَقَدۡ جَآءَکَ
So be thou not => فَلَا تَکُوۡنَنَّ
Only those can accept who => اِنَّمَا یَسۡتَجِیۡبُ الَّذِیۡنَ
Allah will raise them <em>to life => یَبۡعَثُہُمُ اللّٰہُ
will you call upon any other than Allah => اَغَیۡرَ اللّٰہِ تَدۡعُوۡنَ
Why\, then\, when Our punishment came upon them\, did they not => فَلَوۡلَاۤ اِذۡ جَآءَہُمۡ بَاۡسُنَا
and Satan made all that they did <em>seem </em>fair to them => وَزَیَّنَ لَہُمُ الشَّیۡطٰنُ مَا کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
the wrongdoing people => الۡقَوۡمُ الظّٰلِمُوۡنَ
And We send not => وَمَا نُرۡسِلُ
they disobeyed => کَانُوۡا یَفۡسُقُوۡنَ
I do not say => لَّاۤ اَقُوۡلُ
Will you not then reflect => اَفَلَا تَتَفَکَّرُوۡنَ
And drive not away => وَلَا تَطۡرُدِ

you desire to be hastened => تَسۡتَعۡجِلُوۡنَ بِہٖۤ
you desire to be hastened => تَسۡتَعۡجِلُوۡنَ بِہٖ
surely the matter would be decided => لَقُضِیَ الۡاَمۡرُ
And there falls no => وَمَا تَسۡقُطُ
is <em>recorded </em>in a clear Book => فِیۡ کِتٰبٍ مُّبِیۡنٍ
that the appointed term may be completed => لِیُقۡضٰۤی اَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّی
their true Lord => مَوۡلٰٮہُمُ الۡحَقِّ
And thy people have rejected it => وَکَذَّبَ بِہٖ قَوۡمُکَ
then sit not => فَلَا تَقۡعُدۡ
with the unjust people => مَعَ الۡقَوۡمِ الظّٰلِمِیۡنَ
And those who are righteous are not => الَّذِیۡنَ یَتَّقُوۡنَ

it shall not be accepted => لَّا یُؤۡخَذۡ
and a grievous punishment => وَّعَذَابٌ اَلِیۡمٌۢ
and I am not => وَّمَاۤ اَنَا۠
And his people argued with him => وَحَآجَّہٗ قَوۡمُہٗ
And I fear not => وَلَاۤ اَخَافُ
Will you not then be admonished => اَفَلَا تَتَذَکَّرُوۡنَ
when you fear not => وَلَا تَخَافُوۡنَ
and mix not up => وَلَمۡ یَلۡبِسُوۡۤا

so follow thou their guidance => فَبِہُدٰٮہُمُ اقۡتَدِہۡ
I ask not of you => لَّاۤ اَسۡـَٔلُکُمۡ
And they do not make => وَمَا قَدَرُوا

and We see not with you => وَمَا نَرٰی مَعَکُمۡ

Who causes the grain and the date-stones to sprou => فَالِقُ الۡحَبِّ وَالنَّوٰی

And thus do We vary the Signs => وَکَذٰلِکَ نُصَرِّفُ الۡاٰیٰتِ
And We have not made thee => وَمَا جَعَلۡنٰکَ
And revile not => وَلَا تَسُبُّوا
lest they\, out of spite\, revile Allah => فَیَسُبُّوا اللّٰہَ عَدۡوًۢا

they earned => کَانُوۡا یَکۡسِبُوۡنَ
And the worldly life deceived them => وَّغَرَّتۡہُمُ الۡحَیٰوۃُ
That is because => ذٰلِکَ اَنۡ

His is the creation => لَہُ الۡخَلۡقُ

He does not love => لَا یُحِبُّ
And create not disorder => وَلَا تُفۡسِدُوۡا

the Lord of the worlds => رَّبِّ الۡعٰلَمِیۡنَ
and give you sincere advice => وَاَنۡصَحُ لَکُمۡ
and that you may be shown mercy => وَلَعَلَّکُمۡ تُرۡحَمُوۡنَ
They were indeed => اِنَّہُمۡ کَانُوۡا
a blind people => قَوۡمًا عَمِیۡنَ
you have no => مَا لَکُمۡ
other deity but Him => اِلٰہٍ غَیۡرُہٗۤ
Will you not then be God-fearing => اَفَلَا تَتَّقُوۡنَ
The disbelieving chiefs of his people => الۡمَلَاُ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا
<em>lost</em> in foolishness => فِیۡ سَفَاہَۃٍ
and we surely think thee => وَّاِنَّا لَنَظُنُّکَ
there is no foolishness in me => لَیۡسَ بِیۡ سَفَاہَۃٌ

Indeed there have<I> already </I>fallen => قَدۡ وَقَعَ
no authority => مِنۡ سُلۡطٰنٍ
by Our mercy => بِرَحۡمَۃٍ مِّنَّا
And they were not => وَمَا کَانُوۡا
other deity => مِّنۡ اِلٰہٍ
Allah’s earth => اَرۡضِ اللّٰہِ
and do her no => وَلَا تَمَسُّوۡہَا
lest a painful punishment seize you => فَیَاۡخُذَکُمۡ عَذَابٌ اَلِیۡمٌ
who were arrogant => الَّذِیۡنَ اسۡتَکۡبَرُوۡا
do disbelieve in => بِہٖ کٰفِرُوۡنَ
So the earthquake seized them and => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ الرَّجۡفَۃُ
I did deliver => لَقَدۡ اَبۡلَغۡتُکُمۡ
unto you and offered you sincere counsel => وَنَصَحۡتُ لَکُمۡ
instead of => مِّنۡ دُوۡنِ
And the answer of his people was no => وَمَا کَانَ جَوَابَ قَوۡمِہٖۤ
and diminish not => وَلَا تَبۡخَسُوا
And sit not => وَلَا تَقۡعُدُوۡا
and the believers => وَالَّذِیۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡا
We have indeed been forging => قَدِ افۡتَرَیۡنَا
against Allah => عَلَی اللّٰہِ
has saved us => اِذۡ نَجّٰٮنَا
And it behoves us not => وَمَا یَکُوۡنُ لَنَاۤ
to return => اَنۡ نَّعُوۡدَ
And the chief men of his people who disbelieved said => وَقَالَ الۡمَلَاُ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا مِنۡ قَوۡمِہٖ
So the earthquake seized them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ الرَّجۡفَۃُ
accused Shu‘aib of lying => کَذَّبُوۡا شُعَیۡبًا
a disbelieving people => قَوۡمٍ کٰفِرِیۡنَ
a Prophet => مِّنۡ نَّبِیٍّ
Then We changed => ثُمَّ بَدَّلۡنَا
<em>their </em>evil<I> condition </I> => مَکَانَ السَّیِّئَۃِ
they perceived not => لَا یَشۡعُرُوۡنَ
Are the people of <em>these </em>towns\, then\, secure => اَفَاَمِنَ اَہۡلُ الۡقُرٰۤی
coming of Our punishment => یَّاۡتِیَہُمۡ بَاۡسُنَا
And are the people of <em>these</em> towns secure => اَوَاَمِنَ اَہۡلُ الۡقُرٰۤی
their hearts => عَلٰی قُلُوۡبِہِمۡ
they should not hear => لَا یَسۡمَعُوۡنَ
And their Messengers did indeed come => وَلَقَدۡ جَآءَتۡہُمۡ رُسُلُہُمۡ
does Allah seal up => یَطۡبَعُ اللّٰہُ
And We found not => وَمَا وَجَدۡنَا
after them => مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِہِمۡ
but they unjustly<I> rejected </I>them => فَظَلَمُوۡا بِہَا
And Moses said => وَقَالَ مُوۡسٰی
It is not meet => حَقِیۡقٌ عَلٰۤی
I have come to you => قَدۡ جِئۡتُکُمۡ
therefore\, let the children of Israel go => فَاَرۡسِلۡ مَعِیَ بَنِیۡۤ اِسۡرٰٓءِیۡلَ
The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said => قَالَ الۡمَلَاُ مِنۡ قَوۡمِ فِرۡعَوۡنَ
a skilful magician => لَسٰحِرٌ عَلِیۡمٌ
And the magicians came => وَجَآءَ السَّحَرَۃُ
We shall\, of course\, have a reward => اِنَّ لَنَا لَاَجۡرًا
we => کُنَّا نَحۡنُ
either => اِمَّاۤ اَنۡ
the<I> first </I>throwers => نَحۡنُ الۡمُلۡقِیۡنَ
and brought forth a great magic => وَجَآءُوۡ بِسِحۡرٍ
So was the Truth established => فَوَقَعَ الۡحَقُّ
their works => مَا کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
And the magicians were impelled => وَاُلۡقِیَ السَّحَرَۃُ
I gave you leave => اٰذَنَ لَکُمۡ
To our Lord<I> then </I>shall we return => اِنَّاۤ اِلٰی رَبِّنَا مُنۡقَلِبُوۡنَ
And thou dost not wreak vengeance => وَمَا تَنۡقِمُ
And the chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said => وَقَالَ الۡمَلَاُ مِنۡ قَوۡمِ فِرۡعَوۡنَ
and let their women live => وَنَسۡتَحۡیٖ نِسَآءَہُمۡ
thou camest to us => اَنۡ تَاۡتِیَنَا
thou camest to us => مَا جِئۡتَنَا
Your Lord is about => عَسٰی رَبُّکُمۡ
And We punished => وَلَقَدۡ اَخَذۡنَاۤ
do not know => لَا یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
thou mayest bring us => تَاۡتِنَا بِہٖ
Then We sent upon them => فَاَرۡسَلۡنَا عَلَیۡہِمُ
a sinful people => قَوۡمًا مُّجۡرِمِیۡنَ
they broke their promise => ہُمۡ یَنۡکُثُوۡنَ
treated Our Signs => کَذَّبُوۡا بِاٰیٰتِنَا
And We caused the people who were considered weak to inherit => وَاَوۡرَثۡنَا الۡقَوۡمَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَانُوۡا یُسۡتَضۡعَفُوۡنَ
And the gracious word of thy Lord was fulfilled => وَتَمَّتۡ کَلِمَتُ رَبِّکَ الۡحُسۡنٰی
all that => مَا کَانَ
And We brought the children of Israel across => وَجٰوَزۡنَا بِبَنِیۡۤ اِسۡرٰٓءِیۡلَ
their idols => اَصۡنَامٍ لَّہُمۡ
<em>As to </em>these\, surely => اِنَّ ہٰٓؤُلَآءِ
all that they do => مَّا کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
And We made Moses a promise => وَوٰعَدۡنَا مُوۡسٰی
Thus the period appointed by his Lord was completed => فَتَمَّ مِیۡقٰتُ رَبِّہٖۤ
and follow not => وَلَا تَتَّبِعۡ
Thou shalt not see Me => لَنۡ تَرٰٮنِیۡ
and Moses fell down => وَّخَرَّ مُوۡسٰی
in an unjust manner => بِغَیۡرِ الۡحَقِّ
they will not believe => لَّا یُؤۡمِنُوۡا
treated Our Signs as lies => کَذَّبُوۡا بِاٰیٰتِنَا
their works are vain => حَبِطَتۡ اَعۡمٰلُہُمۡ
And the people of Moses made => وَاتَّخَذَ قَوۡمُ مُوۡسٰی
producing a lowing sound => لَّہٗ خُوَارٌ
Did they not see => اَلَمۡ یَرَوۡا
spoke not to them => لَا یُکَلِّمُہُمۡ
they were smitten with remorse => سُقِطَ فِیۡۤ اَیۡدِیۡہِمۡ
and were about to => وَکَادُوۡا یَقۡتُلُوۡنَنِیۡ
and place me not => وَلَا تَجۡعَلۡنِیۡ
after that => مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِہَا
thereafter => مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِہَا
for those who => لِّلَّذِیۡنَ ہُمۡ
And Moses chose => وَاخۡتَارَ مُوۡسٰی
before <em>this</em> => مِّنۡ قَبۡلُ
forgive us then => فَاغۡفِرۡ لَنَا
we have turned => اِنَّا ہُدۡنَاۤ
I will inflict => اُصِیۡبُ بِہٖ
and those who => وَالَّذِیۡنَ ہُمۡ
He enjoins on them good => یَاۡمُرُہُمۡ بِالۡمَعۡرُوۡفِ
evil => عَنِ الۡمُنۡکَرِ
these => اُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ
and does justice therewith => وَبِہٖ یَعۡدِلُوۡنَ
twelve => اثۡنَتَیۡ عَشۡرَۃَ
and from it there gushed forth => فَانۡۢبَجَسَتۡ مِنۡہُ
knew => قَدۡ عَلِمَ
And We caused the clouds to overshadow them => وَظَلَّلۡنَا عَلَیۡہِمُ الۡغَمٰمَ
We have provided for you => مَا رَزَقۡنٰکُمۡ
But the transgressors among them changed => فَبَدَّلَ الَّذِیۡنَ ظَلَمُوۡا مِنۡہُمۡ

And Pharaoh said => وَقَالَ فِرۡعَوۡنُ
allow the work of mischief-makers to prosper => یُصۡلِحُ عَمَلَ الۡمُفۡسِدِیۡنَ
And Allah establishes => وَیُحِقُّ اللّٰہُ

We make man taste => اَذَقۡنَا الۡاِنۡسٰنَ
and a great reward => وَّاَجۡرٌ کَبِیۡرٌ
and thy bosom is becoming straitened thereby => وَضَآئِقٌۢ بِہٖ صَدۡرُکَ
And if they do not respond => فَاِلَّمۡ یَسۡتَجِیۡبُوۡا
with Allah’s knowledge => بِعِلۡمِ اللّٰہِ
Will you then => فَہَلۡ اَنۡتُمۡ
shall have nothing => لَیۡسَ لَہُمۡ

And we do not see => وَمَا نَرٰی
They shall certainly meet => اِنَّہُمۡ مُّلٰقُوۡا
Will you not then consider => اَفَلَا تَذَکَّرُوۡنَ
And I say not => وَلَاۤ اَقُوۡلُ
Allah will not bestow any good upon them => یُّؤۡتِیَہُمُ اللّٰہُ خَیۡرًا
thou hast indeed disputed with us => قَدۡ جٰدَلۡتَنَا
And my advice will profit you not => وَلَا یَنۡفَعُکُمۡ نُصۡحِیۡۤ
And address not Me concerning => وَلَا تُخٰطِبۡنِیۡ

and the fountains <em>of the earth</em> gushed forth => وَفَارَ التَّنُّوۡرُ
And Noah cried => وَنَادٰی نُوۡحُۨ
And the wave came in between the two => وَحَالَ بَیۡنَہُمَا الۡمَوۡجُ
And the water was made to subside => وَغِیۡضَ الۡمَآءُ
the wrongdoing people => لِّلۡقَوۡمِ الظّٰلِمِیۡنَ
he is surely not => اِنَّہٗ لَیۡسَ
unrighteous => غَیۡرُ صٰلِحٍ
So ask not of Me => فَلَا تَسۡـَٔلۡنِ
I do not ask of you => لَاۤ اَسۡـَٔلُکُمۡ
And turn not away => وَلَا تَتَوَلَّوۡا
and we are not => وَّمَا نَحۡنُ
We can only say => نَّقُوۡلُ اِلَّا
Beside Him => مِنۡ دُوۡنِہٖ
I have indeed put my trust => اِنِّیۡ تَوَکَّلۡتُ

by Our <em>special</em> mercy => بِرَحۡمَۃٍ مِّنَّا
a severe torment => عَذَابٍ غَلِیۡظٍ
And a curse was made to follow them in this world => وَاُتۡبِعُوۡا فِیۡ ہٰذِہِ الدُّنۡیَا لَعۡنَۃً
So you will not but add => فَمَا تَزِیۡدُوۡنَنِیۡ
in Allah’s earth => فِیۡۤ اَرۡضِ اللّٰہِ
and touch her => وَلَا تَمَسُّوۡہَا
lest a near punishment seize you => فَیَاۡخُذَکُمۡ عَذَابٌ قَرِیۡبٌ
And punishment overtook those who had done wrong => وَاَخَذَ الَّذِیۡنَ ظَلَمُوا الصَّیۡحَۃُ
a roasted calf => بِعِجۡلٍ حَنِیۡذٍ
and\, after => وَمِنۡ وَّرَآءِ
a strange thing => لَشَیۡءٌ عَجِیۡبٌ
Allah’s decree => اَمۡرِ اللّٰہِ
and the glad tidings came to him => وَجَآءَتۡہُ الۡبُشۡرٰی
and felt helpless on their behalf => وَضَاقَ بِہِمۡ ذَرۡعًا
a distressful day => یَوۡمٌ عَصِیۡبٌ
And his people came => وَجَآءَہٗ قَوۡمُہٗ
running towards him\, trembling => یُہۡرَعُوۡنَ اِلَیۡہِ
and before => وَمِنۡ قَبۡلُ
and disgrace me not => وَلَا تُخۡزُوۡنِ
you any rightminded man => رَجُلٌ رَّشِیۡدٌ
Thou surely knowest => لَقَدۡ عَلِمۡتَ
no claim => مِنۡ حَقٍّ
They shall by no means reach => لَنۡ یَّصِلُوۡۤا
And such <em>punishment </em>is not => وَمَا ہِیَ
And give not short => وَلَا تَنۡقُصُوا
a destructive day => یَوۡمٍ مُّحِیۡطٍ
and defraud not => وَلَا تَبۡخَسُوا
with a handsome provision => رِزۡقًا حَسَنًا
And I do not desire => وَمَاۤ اُرِیۡدُ
I only desire => اِنۡ اُرِیۡدُ
we do not understand => مَا نَفۡقَہُ
And thou holdest no => وَمَاۤ اَنۡتَ
act as best => اعۡمَلُوۡا عَلٰی
You will soon know => سَوۡفَ تَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
Our command came => جَآءَ اَمۡرُنَا
As though they had never dwelt => کَاَنۡ لَّمۡ یَغۡنَوۡا
and manifest authority => وَسُلۡطٰنٍ مُّبِیۡنٍ
And a curse was made to follow them in this <em>life </em> => وَاُتۡبِعُوۡا فِیۡ ہٰذِہٖ لَعۡنَۃً
And We did not wrong them => وَمَا ظَلَمۡنٰہُمۡ
and they added to them naugh => وَمَا زَادُوۡہُمۡ
And We delay it not => وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُہٗۤ
for a computed term => لِاَجَلٍ مَّعۡدُوۡدٍ
so long as => مَا دَامَتِ
They only worship => یَعۡبُدُوۡنَ اِلَّا
before => مِّنۡ قَبۡلُ
and We shall surely pay them in full => وَاِنَّا لَمُوَفُّوۡہُمۡ
undiminished => غَیۡرَ مَنۡقُوۡصٍ
And We certainly gave => وَلَقَدۡ اٰتَیۡنَا
ommanded\, and <em>also</em> those who have turned <em>to God </em>with thee; and exceed ye not the bounds\,<I> O believers</I> => وَلَا تَطۡغَوۡا
And incline not => وَلَا تَرۡکَنُوۡۤا
lest the Fire touch you => فَتَمَسَّکُمُ النَّارُ
And you shall have no => وَمَا لَکُمۡ
Why\, then\, were there not => فَلَوۡلَا کَانَ
And thy Lord would not => وَمَا کَانَ رَبُّکَ
one people => اُمَّۃً وّٰحِدَۃً
but they would not cease => وَلَا یَزَالُوۡنَ
But the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled => وَتَمَّتۡ کَلِمَۃُ رَبِّکَ
We make thy heart firm => نُثَبِّتُ بِہٖ فُؤَادَکَ

so that your father’s favour may become exclusively yours => یَّخۡلُ لَکُمۡ وَجۡہُ اَبِیۡکُمۡ

One of them => قَآئِلٌ مِّنۡہُمۡ

of this affair of theirs => بِاَمۡرِہِمۡ ہٰذَا

Your device is indeed mighty => اِنَّ کَیۡدَکُنَّ عَظِیۡمٌ

He has infatuated her => قَدۡ شَغَفَہَا
this is => اِنۡ ہٰذَاۤ
So his Lord heard his prayer => فَاسۡتَجَابَ لَہٗ رَبُّہٗ
they had seen => مَا رَاَوُا
And with him there entered => وَدَخَلَ مَعَہُ
And the other said => وَّقَالَ الۡاٰخَرُ

we conceal and what => نُخۡفِیۡ وَمَا
whether => مِنۡ شَیۡءٍ
And think not => وَلَا تَحۡسَبَنَّ
He only gives them respite => اِنَّمَا یُؤَخِّرُہُمۡ

but they will soon => فَسَوۡفَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
And We have never destroyed => وَمَاۤ اَہۡلَکۡنَا
people => مِنۡ اُمَّۃٍ
Why dost thou not bring angels to us => لَّوۡ مَا تَاۡتِیۡنَا
We do not send down => مَا نُنَزِّلُ
and then they are granted no respite => وَمَا کَانُوۡۤا اِذًا مُّنۡظَرِیۡنَ
a bewitched people => قَوۡمٌ مَّسۡحُوۡرُوۡنَ
And We have\, indeed\, made => وَلَقَدۡ جَعَلۡنَا
a bright flame => شِہَابٌ مُّبِیۡنٌ
and caused everything to grow therein => وَاَنۡۢبَتۡنَا فِیۡہَا مِنۡ کُلِّ
in a known measure => بِقَدَرٍ مَّعۡلُوۡمٍ
and you are not => وَمَاۤ اَنۡتُمۡ
to store it up => لَہٗ بِخٰزِنِیۡنَ
So the angels submitted => فَسَجَدَ الۡمَلٰٓئِکَۃُ
the appointed time => الۡوَقۡتِ الۡمَعۡلُوۡمِ
Thy chosen servants from among them => عِبَادَکَ مِنۡہُمُ الۡمُخۡلَصِیۡنَ
as <em>choose to</em> follow thee => مَنِ اتَّبَعَکَ
I am surely => اَنِّیۡۤ اَنَا

we give thee glad tidings => اِنَّا نُبَشِّرُکَ
Them we shall save => اِنَّا لَمُنَجُّوۡہُمۡ

so put me not to shame => فَلَا تَفۡضَحُوۡنِ

lie on a manifest way => لَبِاِمَامٍ مُّبِیۡنٍ
did treat the Messengers as liars => کَذَّبَ اَصۡحٰبُ الۡحِجۡرِ
But the punishment seized them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمُ الصَّیۡحَۃُ
And We have not created => وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا
and the Hour is sure => وَاِنَّ السَّاعَۃَ
in a comely manner => الصَّفۡحَ الۡجَمِیۡلَ
And We have\, indeed\, given thee => وَلَقَدۡ اٰتَیۡنٰکَ

and grieve not => وَلَا تَحۡزَنۡ
a plain Warner => النَّذِیۡرُ الۡمُبِیۡنُ
they used to do => کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
We will\, surely\, suffice thee => اِنَّا کَفَیۡنٰکَ
so seek ye not to hasten it => فَلَا تَسۡتَعۡجِلُوۡہُ
And in them there is beauty for you => وَلَکُمۡ فِیۡہَا جَمَالٌ
you do not <em>yet</em> know => لَا تَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
and all kinds of => وَمِنۡ کُلِّ
and they know not => وَمَا یَشۡعُرُوۡنَ
is One God => اِلٰہٌ وّٰحِدٌ
but Allah came => فَاَتَی اللّٰہُ
and the punishment came upon them => وَاَتٰٮہُمُ الۡعَذَابُ
to the righteous => لِلَّذِیۡنَ اتَّقَوۡا
through them => مِنۡ تَحۡتِہَا
So the evil <em>result </em>of what they did befell them => فَاَصَابَہُمۡ سَیِّاٰتُ مَا عَمِلُوۡا
And for such there are no => وَمَا لَہُمۡ
and that those who disbelieved may know => وَلِیَعۡلَمَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡۤا
they do not know => لَا یَشۡعُرُوۡنَ
so that they shall not => فَمَا ہُمۡ
Have they not seen => اَوَلَمۡ یَرَوۡا
creature => مِنۡ دَآبَّۃٍ
above them => مِّنۡ فَوۡقِہِمۡ
So fear Me alone => فَاِیّٰیَ فَارۡہَبُوۡنِ
blessing => مِّنۡ نِّعۡمَۃٍ
do not believe => لَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
and their tongues utter => وَتَصِفُ اَلۡسِنَتُہُمُ
theirs shall be => اَنَّ لَہُمُ
And We have not sent down => وَمَاۤ اَنۡزَلۡنَا
and wholesome food => وَّرِزۡقًا حَسَنًا
And thy Lord has inspired => وَاَوۡحٰی رَبُّکَ
the bee => اِلَی النَّحۡلِ
and in the trellises which they build => وَمِمَّا یَعۡرِشُوۡنَ
But those more favoured will not => فَمَا الَّذِیۡنَ فُضِّلُوۡا
Will they then believe in vain things => اَفَبِالۡبٰطِلِ یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
So coin not => فَلَا تَضۡرِبُوۡا
And Allah sets forth => وَضَرَبَ اللّٰہُ
Do they not see => اَلَمۡ یَرَوۡا
your homes => مِّنۡۢ بُیُوۡتِکُمۡ
then thou art responsible => فَاِنَّمَا عَلَیۡکَ
it will not be made light => فَلَا یُخَفَّفُ

they had been persecuted => مَا فُتِنُوۡا
so Allah made it taste => فَاَذٰقَہَا اللّٰہُ

This is Allah\, your Lord => ذٰلِکُمُ اللّٰہُ رَبُّکُمۡ
There is no God but He => لَاۤ اِلٰہَ اِلَّا ہُوَ
And He is not pleased => وَلَا یَرۡضٰی

bearer of burden shall bear => تَزِرُ وَازِرَۃٌ
you have been doing => کُنۡتُمۡ تَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
Surely\, He knows full well => اِنَّہٗ عَلِیۡمٌۢ
all that is hidden in the breasts => بِذَاتِ الصُّدُوۡرِ
pray for before => یَدۡعُوۡۤا اِلَیۡہِ مِنۡ قَبۡلُ
and begins to assign rivals to Allah => وَجَعَلَ لِلّٰہِ اَنۡدَادًا
that he may lead <em>men</em> astray from His way => لِّیُضِلَّ عَنۡ سَبِیۡلِہٖ
Is he who => اَمَّنۡ ہُوَ
Are those who know equal to those who know not => ہَلۡ یَسۡتَوِی الَّذِیۡنَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ وَالَّذِیۡنَ لَا یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
endowed with understanding will take heed => یَتَذَکَّرُ اُولُوا الۡاَلۡبٰبِ
And Allah’s earth => وَاَرۡضُ اللّٰہِ
the manifest loss => الۡخُسۡرَانُ الۡمُبِیۡنُ
over them => مِّنۡ فَوۡقِہِمۡ
and beneath them => وَمِنۡ تَحۡتِہِمۡ
against whom the sentence of punishment has become due => حَقَّ عَلَیۡہِ کَلِمَۃُ الۡعَذَابِ
there are lofty mansions built over lofty mansions => غُرَفٌ مِّنۡ فَوۡقِہَا غُرَفٌ مَّبۡنِیَّۃٌ
Allah has made that promise => وَّعۡدَ اللّٰہِ
Allah breaks not <em>His</em> promise => لَا یُخۡلِفُ اللّٰہُ الۡمِیۡعَادَ
and causes it to flow in <em>the form of</em> streamlets => فَسَلَکَہٗ یَنٰبِیۡعَ
for men of understanding => لِاُولِی الۡاَلۡبٰبِ
Is he then whose bosom Allah has opened for <em>the acceptance of</em> Islam => اَفَمَنۡ شَرَحَ اللّٰہُ صَدۡرَہٗ لِلۡاِسۡلٰمِ
Woe\, then\, to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah => فَوَیۡلٌ لِّلۡقٰسِیَۃِ قُلُوۡبُہُمۡ مِّنۡ ذِکۡرِ اللّٰہِ
he shall have no => فَمَا لَہٗ مِنۡ
Is he\, then\, who has nothing but his own face to protect him with from the evil punishment => اَفَمَنۡ یَّتَّقِیۡ بِوَجۡہِہٖ سُوۡٓءَ الۡعَذَابِ
so the punishment came upon them => فَاَتٰٮہُمُ الۡعَذَابُ
whence => مِنۡ حَیۡثُ
they knew not => لَا یَشۡعُرُوۡنَ
So Allah made them taste => فَاَذَاقَہُمُ اللّٰہُ
they but knew => کَانُوۡا یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
deviation from rectitude => ذِیۡ عِوَجٍ
Surely thou wilt die => اِنَّکَ مَیِّتٌ
you will dispute with one another before your Lord => عِنۡدَ رَبِّکُمۡ تَخۡتَصِمُوۡنَ
these it is who are the righteous => اُولٰٓئِکَ ہُمُ الۡمُتَّقُوۡنَ
So that Allah will remove => لِیُکَفِّرَ اللّٰہُ
according to => الَّذِیۡ کَانُوۡا
guide => مِنۡ ہَادٍ
to lead him astray => لَہٗ مِنۡ مُّضِلٍّ
and on whom there descends => وَیَحِلُّ عَلَیۡہِ
with truth for <em>the good of</em> mankind => لِلنَّاسِ بِالۡحَقِّ
And thou art not => وَمَاۤ اَنۡتَ
And even if => وَلَوۡ اَنَّ
And the evil <em>consequences </em>of what they had earned will become apparent to them => وَبَدَا لَہُمۡ سَیِّاٰتُ مَا کَسَبُوۡا
and that which they used to mock at will encompass them => وَحَاقَ بِہِمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا بِہٖ یَسۡتَہۡزِءُوۡنَ
This has been given to me => اِنَّمَاۤ اُوۡتِیۡتُہٗ
said the same thing => قَدۡ قَالَہَا

for whomsoever He pleases => لِمَنۡ یَّشَآءُ
Verily He => اِنَّہٗ ہُوَ
you shall not be helped => لَا تُنۡصَرُوۡنَ
comes upon you => اَنۡ یَّاۡتِیَکُمُ
thou didst treat them as lies => فَکَذَّبۡتَ بِہَا
And Allah will deliver => وَیُنَجِّی اللّٰہُ
the righteous => الَّذِیۡنَ اتَّقَوۡا
shall not touch them => لَا یَمَسُّہُمُ
Is it other <em>gods </em>than Allah => اَفَغَیۡرَ اللّٰہِ

and its Keepers will say to them => وَقَالَ لَہُمۡ خَزَنَتُہَاۤ
And those who feared their Lord will be conducted => وَسِیۡقَ الَّذِیۡنَ اتَّقَوۡا رَبَّہُمۡ
and its gates are opened => وَفُتِحَتۡ اَبۡوٰبُہَا
and its Keepers say to them => وَقَالَ لَہُمۡ خَزَنَتُہَا
has fulfilled His promise to us => صَدَقَنَا وَعۡدَہٗ
and has given us the land for an inheritance => وَاَوۡرَثَنَا الۡاَرۡضَ

and every nation strove => وَہَمَّتۡ کُلُّ اُمَّۃٍۭ

And make them\, our Lord\, enter => رَبَّنَا وَاَدۡخِلۡہُمۡ
Gardens of Eternity => جَنّٰتِ عَدۡنٍ
him hast Thou surely shown mercy => فَقَدۡ رَحِمۡتَہٗ
And that<I> indeed </I>is the supreme triumph => وَذٰلِکَ ہُوَ الۡفَوۡزُ
your <em>own</em> abhorrence of yourselves <em>today</em> => مَّقۡتِکُمۡ اَنۡفُسَکُمۡ
he who turns <em>to God</em> => مَنۡ یُّنِیۡبُ
Lord of the Throne => ذُو الۡعَرۡشِ
whomsoever => عَلٰی مَنۡ
The day when they will <em>all </em>come forth => یَوۡمَ ہُمۡ بٰرِزُوۡنَ
concerning them => مِنۡہُمۡ شَیۡءٌ
every soul be requited => تُجۡزٰی کُلُّ نَفۡسٍۭ
the Approaching Day => یَوۡمَ الۡاٰزِفَۃِ
loving friend => مِنۡ حَمِیۡمٍ
And Allah judges => وَاللّٰہُ یَقۡضِیۡ
but those on whom they call => وَالَّذِیۡنَ یَدۡعُوۡنَ
Allah is the All-Hearing\, the All-Seeing => اللّٰہَ ہُوَ السَّمِیۡعُ الۡبَصِیۡرُ
Have they not travelled => اَوَلَمۡ یَسِیۡرُوۡا
those => الَّذِیۡنَ کَانُوۡا
They were => کَانُوۡا ہُمۡ
But Allah seized them => فَاَخَذَہُمُ اللّٰہُ
and they had no protector against Allah => وَمَا کَانَ لَہُمۡ مِّنَ اللّٰہِ مِنۡ وَّاقٍ
so Allah seized them => فَاَخَذَہُمُ اللّٰہُ
Surely He is Powerful => اِنَّہٗ قَوِیٌّ
And We did send => وَلَقَدۡ اَرۡسَلۡنَا
And when he came to them => فَلَمَّا جَآءَہُمۡ
from Us => مِنۡ عِنۡدِنَا
and let their women live => وَاسۡتَحۡیُوۡا نِسَآءَہُمۡ
And a believing man => وَقَالَ رَجُلٌ مُّؤۡمِنٌ
because he says => اَنۡ یَّقُوۡلَ
one who is => مَنۡ ہُوَ
I only point out to you => اُرِیۡکُمۡ اِلَّا
And he who believed said => وَقَالَ الَّذِیۡۤ اٰمَنَ
the day of mutual calling => یَوۡمَ التَّنَادِ
No defender shall you have against Allah => مَا لَکُمۡ مِّنَ اللّٰہِ مِنۡ عَاصِمٍ
And for him whom Allah adjudges astray shall be no guide => وَمَنۡ یُّضۡلِلِ اللّٰہُ فَمَا لَہٗ مِنۡ
but you ceased not => فَمَا زِلۡتُمۡ
Allah will never raise up => لَنۡ یَّبۡعَثَ اللّٰہُ
does Allah adjudge as lost => یُضِلُّ اللّٰہُ
those who => مَنۡ ہُوَ
and the design of Pharaoh ended in nothing but ruin => وَمَا کَیۡدُ فِرۡعَوۡنَ اِلَّا فِیۡ تَبَابٍ
this life of the world is but a <em>temporary </em>provision => اِنَّمَا ہٰذِہِ الۡحَیٰوۃُ الدُّنۡیَا مَتٰعٌ
and the Hereafter is certainly => وَّاِنَّ الۡاٰخِرَۃَ
the home for permanent stay => ہِیَ دَارُ الۡقَرَارِ
will be requited only with the like of it => فَلَا یُجۡزٰۤی اِلَّا مِثۡلَہَا
and is a believe => وَہُوَ مُؤۡمِنٌ
how <em>strange</em> => مَا لِیۡۤ
Surely => لَا جَرَمَ
to which you call me => تَدۡعُوۡنَنِیۡۤ اِلَیۡہِ
has no <em>title </em>to be called upon => لَیۡسَ لَہٗ دَعۡوَۃٌ
the transgressors => الۡمُسۡرِفِیۡنَ ہُمۡ
The result was that Allah preserved him => فَوَقٰٮہُ اللّٰہُ
and a grievous punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh => وَحَاقَ بِاٰلِ فِرۡعَوۡنَ سُوۡٓءُ الۡعَذَابِ
Cast Pharaoh’s people into the severest punishment => اَدۡخِلُوۡۤا اٰلَ فِرۡعَوۡنَ اَشَدَّ الۡعَذَابِ
will you then relieve us of => فَہَلۡ اَنۡتُمۡ مُّغۡنُوۡنَ عَنَّا
a portion of the Fire => نَصِیۡبًا مِّنَ النَّارِ
Allah has already judged between <em>His </em>servants => اِنَّ اللّٰہَ قَدۡ حَکَمَ بَیۡنَ الۡعِبَادِ
And those in the Fire will say => وَقَالَ الَّذِیۡنَ فِی النَّارِ
that He may lighten for us => یُخَفِّفۡ عَنَّا
the punishment for a <em>single </em>day => یَوۡمًا مِّنَ الۡعَذَابِ
Did not => اَوَلَمۡ تَکُ
is of no avail => اِلَّا فِیۡ ضَلٰلٍ
Most surely We help => اِنَّا لَنَنۡصُرُ
in the present life => فِی الۡحَیٰوۃِ الدُّنۡیَا
will not profit => لَا یَنۡفَعُ
and made the children of Israel the inheritors of the Book => وَاَوۡرَثۡنَا بَنِیۡۤ اِسۡرٰٓءِیۡلَ الۡکِتٰبَ
Those who dispute => اِنَّ الَّذِیۡنَ یُجٰدِلُوۡنَ
which they will never attain => مَّا ہُمۡ بِبٰلِغِیۡہِ
And the blind and the seeing are not equal => وَمَا یَسۡتَوِی الۡاَعۡمٰی وَالۡبَصِیۡرُ
and do good deeds => وَعَمِلُوا الصّٰلِحٰتِ
do you reflect => مَّا تَتَذَکَّرُوۡنَ
The Hour will surely come => اِنَّ السَّاعَۃَ لَاٰتِیَۃٌ
And your Lord says => وَقَالَ رَبُّکُمُ
It is Allah Who => اللّٰہُ الَّذِیۡ
Verily\, Allah is the Lord of bounty => اِنَّ اللّٰہَ لَذُوۡ فَضۡلٍ
to worship => اَنۡ اَعۡبُدَ
a term appointed => اَجَلًا مُّسَمًّی
and that you may learn wisdom => وَّلَعَلَّکُمۡ تَعۡقِلُوۡنَ
those who => اِلَی الَّذِیۡنَ
But soon will they come to know => فَسَوۡفَ یَعۡلَمُوۡنَ
When the iron-collars => اِذِ الۡاَغۡلٰلُ
you associated => کُنۡتُمۡ تُشۡرِکُوۡنَ
we never prayed to anything before => لَّمۡ نَکُنۡ نَّدۡعُوۡا مِنۡ قَبۡلُ شَیۡـًٔا
Thus will Allah confound => کَذٰلِکَ یُضِلُّ اللّٰہُ
you behaved insolently => کُنۡتُمۡ تَمۡرَحُوۡنَ
Allah’s decree => اَمۡرُ اللّٰہِ
and then there perished => وَخَسِرَ ہُنَالِکَ
and eat of some of them => وَمِنۡہَا تَاۡکُلُوۡنَ
and that\, by means of them\, you may satisfy any desire => وَلِتَبۡلُغُوۡا عَلَیۡہَا حَاجَۃً
But all that which they earned was of no avail to them => فَمَاۤ اَغۡنٰی عَنۡہُمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا یَکۡسِبُوۡنَ
in the knowledge which they possessed => بِمَا عِنۡدَہُمۡ مِّنَ الۡعِلۡمِ
And that at which they mocked encompassed them => وَحَاقَ بِہِمۡ مَّا کَانُوۡا بِہٖ یَسۡتَہۡزِءُوۡنَ
which we used to associate with Him => کُنَّا بِہٖ مُشۡرِکِیۡنَ
But their faith could not profit them => فَلَمۡ یَکُ یَنۡفَعُہُمۡ اِیۡمٰنُہُمۡ
Allah’s law => سُنَّتَ اللّٰہِ
that has <em>ever </em>been in operation => الَّتِیۡ قَدۡ خَلَتۡ
And thus have perished => وَخَسِرَ ہُنَالِکَ
the Qur’an in clear\, eloquent language => قُرۡاٰنًا عَرَبِیًّا
But most of them turn away => فَاَعۡرَضَ اَکۡثَرُہُمۡ
and between us => وَّمِنۡۢ بَیۡنِنَا
that your God is One God => اَنَّمَاۤ اِلٰہُکُمۡ اِلٰہٌ وّٰحِدٌ
they will surely have a reward that will never end => لَہُمۡ اَجۡرٌ غَیۡرُ مَمۡنُوۡنٍ
therein firm mountains => فِیۡہَا رَوٰسِیَ
above its => مِنۡ فَوۡقِہَا
in two days => فِیۡ یَوۡمَیۡنِ
each heaven => کُلِّ سَمَآءٍ
before them => بَیۡنِ اَیۡدِیۡہِمۡ
and behind them => وَمِنۡ خَلۡفِہِمۡ
Worship none => اَلَّا تَعۡبُدُوۡۤا
a furious wind => رِیۡحًا صَرۡصَرًا
for several ominous days => فِیۡۤ اَیَّامٍ نَّحِسَاتٍ
will not be helped => لَا یُنۡصَرُوۡنَ
so the calamity of a humiliating punishment seized them => فَاَخَذَتۡہُمۡ صٰعِقَۃُ الۡعَذَابِ الۡہُوۡنِ
on account of what they had earned => بِمَا کَانُوۡا یَکۡسِبُوۡنَ
and acted righteously => وَکَانُوۡا یَتَّقُوۡنَ
they will be goaded on => فَہُمۡ یُوۡزَعُوۡنَ
when => اِذَا مَا
they had been doing => کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
Allah has made us to speak => اَنۡطَقَنَا اللّٰہُ
And you did not fear => وَمَا کُنۡتُمۡ تَسۡتَتِرُوۡنَ
your ears and your eyes and your skins => سَمۡعُکُمۡ وَلَاۤ اَبۡصٰرُکُمۡ وَلَا جُلُوۡدُکُمۡ
their abode => مَثۡوًی لَّہُمۡ
gone => قَدۡ خَلَتۡ
Surely\, they were <em>the</em> losers => اِنَّہُمۡ کَانُوۡا خٰسِرِیۡنَ
Listen not => لَا تَسۡمَعُوۡا
but make noise during its <em>recital </em> => وَالۡغَوۡا فِیۡہِ
And most certainly We will make those who disbelieve taste => فَلَنُذِیۡقَنَّ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا
for the worst of their deeds => اَسۡوَاَ الَّذِیۡ کَانُوۡا یَعۡمَلُوۡنَ
there will be an abiding home therein => فِیۡہَا دَارُ الۡخُلۡدِ
And those who disbelieve will say => وَقَالَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡا
Therein you will have => وَلَکُمۡ فِیۡہَا
and does good works => وَعَمِلَ صٰلِحًا
And good and evil are not alike => وَلَا تَسۡتَوِی الۡحَسَنَۃُ وَلَا السَّیِّئَۃُ
And lo\, he between whom and thyself => فَاِذَا الَّذِیۡ بَیۡنَکَ وَبَیۡنَہٗ
will become as though he were a warm friend => کَاَنَّہٗ وَلِیٌّ حَمِیۡمٌ
a large share of good => حَظٍّ عَظِیۡمٍ
Prostrate not yourselves => لَا تَسۡجُدُوۡا
And among His Signs => وَمِنۡ اٰیٰتِہٖۤ
that thou seest => اَنَّکَ تَرَی
can quicken the dead => لَمُحۡیِ الۡمَوۡتٰۤی
are not hidden from Us => لَا یَخۡفَوۡنَ عَلَیۡنَاۤ
Is he\, then\, who is cast => اَفَمَنۡ یُّلۡقٰی
when it comes to them => لَمَّا جَآءَہُمۡ
And\, truly\, it is a mighty Book => وَاِنَّہٗ لَکِتٰبٌ
Falsehood cannot approach it => لَّا یَاۡتِیۡہِ الۡبٰطِلُ
from before => مِنۡۢ بَیۡنِ یَدَیۡہِ
Nothing is said => مَّا یُقَالُ
what was said => مَا قَدۡ قِیۡلَ
Thy Lord is indeed the Master => اِنَّ رَبَّکَ لَذُوۡ
Qur’an in a foreign tongue => قُرۡاٰنًا اَعۡجَمِیًّا
Why have not its verses been made clear => لَوۡلَا فُصِّلَتۡ اٰیٰتُہٗۤ
What! a foreign tongue and an Arab => اٰ۬عۡجَمِیٌّ وَّعَرَبِیٌّ
It is a guidance and a healing for those who believe => لِلَّذِیۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡا ہُدًی وَّشِفَآءٌ
But <em>as to those</em> who believe not => وَالَّذِیۡنَ لَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
there is a deafness in their ears => فِیۡۤ اٰذَانِہِمۡ وَقۡرٌ
They are\, <em>as it were</em>\, being called to => اُولٰٓئِکَ یُنَادَوۡنَ
And We did give Moses the Book => وَلَقَدۡ اٰتَیۡنَا مُوۡسَی الۡکِتٰبَ
and certainly they are in a disquieting doubt about it => وَاِنَّہُمۡ لَفِیۡ شَکٍّ مِّنۡہُ مُرِیۡبٍ
And thy Lord is not at all => وَمَا رَبُّکَ
unjust to <em>His </em>servants => بِظَلّٰمٍ لِّلۡعَبِیۡدِ
And no fruits come forth => وَمَا تَخۡرُجُ مِنۡ ثَمَرٰتٍ
does any female bear <em>a child</em> => تَحۡمِلُ مِنۡ اُنۡثٰی
<em>saying</em>\, “Where are My ‘Partners => اَیۡنَ شُرَکَآءِیۡ
is a witness => مِنۡ شَہِیۡدٍ
will be lost to them => وَضَلَّ عَنۡہُمۡ
that they have no place of escape => مَا لَہُمۡ مِّنۡ مَّحِیۡصٍ
Man does not tire => لَّا یَسۡـَٔمُ الۡاِنۡسٰنُ
he despairs\, <em>and </em>gives up <em>all </em>hope => فَیَـُٔوۡسٌ قَنُوۡطٌ
and I do not think the Hour will <em>ever</em> come => وَمَاۤ اَظُنُّ السَّاعَۃَ قَآئِمَۃً
I shall surely have => اِنَّ لِیۡ
hard punishment => مِّنۡ عَذَابٍ غَلِیۡظٍ
turning aside => وَنَاٰ بِجَانِبِہٖ
lo! he <em>starts </em>offering long prayers => فَذُوۡ دُعَآءٍ عَرِیۡضٍ
you disbelieve in it => کَفَرۡتُمۡ بِہٖ
who is more astray => مَنۡ اَضَلُّ
than one who => مِمَّنۡ ہُوَ
drifted => فِیۡ شِقَاقٍۭ
that thy Lord => بِرَبِّکَ اَنَّہٗ
is Witness over all things => عَلٰی کُلِّ شَیۡءٍ شَہِیۡدٌ
they are surely in doubt => اِنَّہُمۡ فِیۡ مِرۡیَۃٍ
encompasses all things => بِکُلِّ شَیۡءٍ مُّحِیۡطٌۢ
and to those that preceded thee => وَاِلَی الَّذِیۡنَ مِنۡ قَبۡلِکَ
Allah\, the Mighty\, the Wise => اللّٰہُ الۡعَزِیۡزُ الۡحَکِیۡمُ
whatever is in the heavens => مَا فِی السَّمٰوٰتِ
and whatever is in the earth => وَمَا فِی الۡاَرۡضِ
and He is the High\, the Great => وَہُوَ الۡعَلِیُّ الۡعَظِیۡمُ
The heavens may well-nigh => تَکَادُ السَّمٰوٰتُ
on the earth => فِی الۡاَرۡضِ
Behold! it is surely Allah => اَلَاۤ اِنَّ اللّٰہَ
Most Forgiving\, the Merciful => الۡغَفُوۡرُ الرَّحِیۡمُ
protectors beside Him => مِنۡ دُوۡنِہٖۤ اَوۡلِیَآءَ
Allah watches over them => اللّٰہُ حَفِیۡظٌ عَلَیۡہِمۡ
and thou art not a guardian over them => وَّمَاۤ اَنۡتَ عَلَیۡہِمۡ بِوَکِیۡلٍ
the Mother of towns => اُمَّ الۡقُرٰی
and all around it => وَمَنۡ حَوۡلَہَا
</I>of the Day of Gathering => یَوۡمَ الۡجَمۡعِ
whereof there is no doubt => لِّلۡمُتَّقِیۡنَ
And if Allah had <em>so </em>pleased => وَلَوۡ شَآءَ
they will have no protector => مَا لَہُمۡ مِّنۡ
protectors other than Him => مِنۡ دُوۡنِہٖۤ اَوۡلِیَآءَ
Who is the <em>real </em>Protector => ہُوَ الۡوَلِیُّ
And He quickens the dead => وَہُوَ یُحۡیِ الۡمَوۡتٰی
And in whatsoever you differ => وَمَا اخۡتَلَفۡتُمۡ فِیۡہِ مِنۡ شَیۡءٍ
the decision thereof <em>rests </em>with Allah => فَحُکۡمُہٗۤ اِلَی اللّٰہِ
in Him I put my trust => عَلَیۡہِ تَوَکَّلۡتُ
<I> He is </I>the Maker of the heavens => فَاطِرُ السَّمٰوٰتِ
pairs of your own selves => مِّنۡ اَنۡفُسِکُمۡ اَزۡوٰجًا
the keys of the heavens => مَقَالِیۡدُ السَّمٰوٰتِ
the provision for whomsoever => الرِّزۡقَ لِمَنۡ
Surely\, He knows all things full well => اِنَّہٗ بِکُلِّ شَیۡءٍ عَلِیۡمٌ
He has prescribed for you the religion => شَرَعَ لَکُمۡ مِّنَ الدِّیۡنِ
We have revealed to thee => اَوۡحَیۡنَاۤ اِلَیۡکَ
Remain steadfast in obedience => اَنۡ اَقِیۡمُوا الدِّیۡنَ
and be not divided therein => وَلَا تَتَفَرَّقُوۡا فِیۡہِ
Hard upon the idolaters => کَبُرَ عَلَی الۡمُشۡرِکِیۡنَ
Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases => اَللّٰہُ یَجۡتَبِیۡۤ اِلَیۡہِ مَنۡ یَّشَآءُ
And they did not become divided => وَمَا تَفَرَّقُوۡۤا
but after knowledge had come to them => اِلَّا مِنۡۢ بَعۡدِ مَا جَآءَہُمُ الۡعِلۡمُ
for an appointed term => اَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّی
would surely have been decided between them => لَّقُضِیَ بَیۡنَہُمۡ
disquieting doubt concerning it => شَکٍّ مِّنۡہُ مُرِیۡبٍ
To this\, then\, do thou invite => فَلِذٰلِکَ فَادۡعُ
as thou art commanded => کَمَاۤ اُمِرۡتَ
I believe in whatever => اٰمَنۡتُ بِمَاۤ
Allah has sent down => اَنۡزَلَ اللّٰہُ
Book => مِنۡ کِتٰبٍ
and I am commanded to judge justly => وَّاُمِرۡتُ لِاَعۡدِلَ
between us and you => بَیۡنَنَا وَبَیۡنَکُمُ
accepted => مَا اسۡتُجِیۡبَ
severe punishment => عَذَابٌ شَدِیۡدٌ
with truth and <em>also </em>the Balance => بِالۡحَقِّ وَالۡمِیۡزَانَ
that the Hour may be near at hand => لَعَلَّ السَّاعَۃَ قَرِیۡبٌ
Benignant to His servants => لَطِیۡفٌۢ بِعِبَادِہٖ
the Powerful\, the Mighty => الۡقَوِیُّ الۡعَزِیۡزُ
We give him increase => نَزِدۡ لَہٗ
but in the Hereafter he will have no share => وَمَا لَہٗ فِی الۡاٰخِرَۃِ مِنۡ نَّصِیۡبٍ
lawful for them => شَرَعُوۡا لَہُمۡ
Allah has not allowed => لَمۡ یَاۡذَنۡۢ بِہِ اللّٰہُ
And surely the wrongdoers => وَاِنَّ الظّٰلِمِیۡنَ
Thou wilt see the wrongdoers => تَرَی الظّٰلِمِیۡنَ
the great bounty => الۡفَضۡلُ الۡکَبِیۡرُ
except<I> that I am inviting you to God because of </I>love of kinship => اِلَّا الۡمَوَدَّۃَ فِی الۡقُرۡبٰی
And whoso earns a good deed => وَمَنۡ یَّقۡتَرِفۡ حَسَنَۃً
We give him increase => نَّزِدۡ لَہٗ
Most Forgiving\, Most Appreciating => غَفُوۡرٌ شَکُوۡرٌ
Do they say => اَمۡ یَقُوۡلُوۡنَ
Allah had <em>so</em> willed => یَّشَاِ اللّٰہُ
thy heart => عَلٰی قَلۡبِکَ
But Allah is blotting out falsehood => وَیَمۡحُ اللّٰہُ الۡبٰطِلَ
sins => عَنِ السَّیِّاٰتِ
what you do => مَا تَفۡعَلُوۡنَ
who believe and do good works => اٰمَنُوۡا وَعَمِلُوا الصّٰلِحٰتِ
out of His grace => مِّنۡ فَضۡلِہٖ
the provision for His servants => الرِّزۡقَ لِعِبَادِہٖ
as He pleases => مَّا یَشَآءُ
Indeed\, He is All-Aware and All-Seeing with regard to His servants => اِنَّہٗ بِعِبَادِہٖ خَبِیۡرٌۢ بَصِیۡرٌ
they have despaired => مَا قَنَطُوۡا
and spreads out His mercy => وَیَنۡشُرُ رَحۡمَتَہٗ
And He is the Protector\, the Praiseworthy => وَہُوَ الۡوَلِیُّ الۡحَمِیۡدُ
And among His Signs => وَمِنۡ اٰیٰتِہٖ
the heavens and the earth => السَّمٰوٰتِ وَالۡاَرۡضِ
and <em>of </em>whatever living creatures He has spread forth in both => وَمَا بَثَّ فِیۡہِمَا مِنۡ دَآبَّۃٍ
And He has the power to gather them together when He pleases => وَہُوَ عَلٰی جَمۡعِہِمۡ اِذَا یَشَآءُ قَدِیۡرٌ
And whatever misfortune befalls you => وَمَاۤ اَصٰبَکُمۡ مِّنۡ مُّصِیۡبَۃٍ
is due to what your own hands have wrought => فَبِمَا کَسَبَتۡ اَیۡدِیۡکُمۡ
many => عَنۡ کَثِیۡرٍ
And you cannot frustrate => وَّمَاۤ اَنۡتُمۡ بِمُعۡجِزِیۡنَ
He can cause the wind to become still => یُسۡکِنِ الرِّیۡحَ
upon the surface thereof => عَلٰی ظَہۡرِہٖۤ
of that which they (the men) have earned => بِمَا کَسَبُوۡا
And <em>He destroys them so that</em> those who dispute about the Signs of Allah may know => وَیَعۡلَمَ الَّذِیۡنَ یُجٰدِلُوۡنَ فِیۡۤ اٰیٰتِنَا
they have no refuge => مَا لَہُمۡ مِّنۡ مَّحِیۡصٍ
And whatever you have been given => فَمَاۤ اُوۡتِیۡتُمۡ مِّنۡ شَیۡءٍ
sins and indecencies => الۡاِثۡمِ وَالۡفَوٰحِشَ
and\, when they are wroth => وَاِذَا مَا غَضِبُوۡا
they forgive => ہُمۡ یَغۡفِرُوۡنَ
and who spend out of what We have provided for them => وَمِمَّا رَزَقۡنٰہُمۡ یُنۡفِقُوۡنَ
a wrong is done to them => اَصَابَہُمُ الۡبَغۡیُ ہُمۡ
injury => سَیِّئَۃٍ سَیِّئَۃٌ
with Allah => عَلَی اللّٰہِ
But there is no blame on those who defend themselves after they have been wronged => وَلَمَنِ انۡتَصَرَ بَعۡدَ ظُلۡمِہٖ فَاُولٰٓئِکَ مَا عَلَیۡہِمۡ مِّنۡ سَبِیۡلٍ
without justification => بِغَیۡرِ الۡحَقِّ
that surely is a matter of strong determination => اِنَّ ذٰلِکَ لَمِنۡ عَزۡمِ الۡاُمُوۡرِ
Allah adjudges astray => یُّضۡلِلِ اللّٰہُ
there is no protector for him thereafter => فَمَا لَہٗ مِنۡ وَّلِیٍّ مِّنۡۢ بَعۡدِہٖ
And those who believe will say => وَقَالَ الَّذِیۡنَ اٰمَنُوۡۤا
The losers indeed => اِنَّ الۡخٰسِرِیۡنَ
are those who ruin => اَلَّذِیۡنَ خَسِرُوۡۤا
Behold => اَلَاۤ اِنَّ
a lasting punishment => عَذَابٍ مُّقِیۡمٍ
And they have no helpers => وَمَا کَانَ لَہُمۡ مِّنۡ اَوۡلِیَآءَ
there is no way <em>at all</em> => فَمَا لَہٗ مِنۡ سَبِیۡلٍ
There will be no refuge for you => مَا لَکُمۡ مِّنۡ مَّلۡجَاٍ
We have not sent thee => فَمَاۤ اَرۡسَلۡنٰکَ
as a guardian over them => عَلَیۡہِمۡ حَفِیۡظًا
Thy duty is only to convey <I>the Message</I> => اِنۡ عَلَیۡکَ اِلَّا الۡبَلٰغُ
We cause man to taste => اَذَقۡنَا الۡاِنۡسٰنَ
of mercy from Us => مِنَّا رَحۡمَۃً
their hands have sent forth => قَدَّمَتۡ اَیۡدِیۡہِمۡ
then lo! man => فَاِنَّ الۡاِنۡسٰنَ
heavens and the earth => السَّمٰوٰتِ وَالۡاَرۡضِ
All-Knowing\, Powerful => عَلِیۡمٌ قَدِیۡرٌ
And it is not for a man => وَمَا کَانَ لِبَشَرٍ
By this perspicuous Book => وَالۡکِتٰبِ الۡمُبِیۡنِ
the Reminder from you => عَنۡکُمُ الذِّکۡرَ
and the example of the earlier peoples has gone before => وَّمَضٰی مَثَلُ الۡاَوَّلِیۡنَ
The Mighty\, the All-Knowing <em>God </em>created them => خَلَقَہُنَّ الۡعَزِیۡزُ الۡعَلِیۡمُ
and We thereby quicken => فَاَنۡشَرۡنَا بِہٖ
and we had not => وَّمَا کُنَّا
And to our Lord surely shall we return. => وَاِنَّاۤ اِلٰی رَبِّنَا لَمُنۡقَلِبُوۡنَ
And a portion of His servants they assert to be His <em>children</em>. Indeed man is clearly ungrateful => مُّبِیۡنٌ
who are => الَّذِیۡنَ ہُمۡ
the Gracious<I> God </I>had <em>so </em>willed => شَآءَ الرَّحۡمٰنُ
we should not have worshipped them => مَا عَبَدۡنٰہُمۡ
They have no knowledge whatsoever of that => مَّا لَہُمۡ بِذٰلِکَ مِنۡ عِلۡمٍ
They do nothing but conjecture => اِنۡ ہُمۡ اِلَّا یَخۡرُصُوۡنَ
before this => مِّنۡ قَبۡلِہٖ
Nay\, they say => بَلۡ قَالُوۡۤا
We never sent => مَاۤ اَرۡسَلۡنَا
and we are following in their footsteps => وَّاِنَّا عَلٰۤی اٰثٰرِہِمۡ مُّقۡتَدُوۡنَ
which you are sent with. => اُرۡسِلۡتُمۡ بِہٖ
and He will surely guide me => فَاِنَّہٗ سَیَہۡدِیۡنِ
Why has not this Qur’an been sent => لَوۡلَا نُزِّلَ ہٰذَا الۡقُرۡاٰنُ
so that some of them may make => لِّیَتَّخِذَ بَعۡضُہُمۡ
one <em>type of</em> people => اُمَّۃً وّٰحِدَۃً
And doors <em>of silver </em>to their houses => وَلِبُیُوۡتِہِمۡ اَبۡوٰبًا
But all that is nothing => وَاِنۡ کُلُّ ذٰلِکَ
And he who turns away => وَمَنۡ یَّعۡشُ
And <em>the fact </em>that you are partners in punishment will not profit you this day for you have acted wrongfully. => وَلَنۡ یَّنۡفَعَکُمُ الۡیَوۡمَ اِذ ظَّلَمۡتُمۡ اَنَّکُمۡ فِی الۡعَذَابِ مُشۡتَرِکُوۡنَ
Canst thou\, then\, make the deaf hear => اَفَاَنۡتَ تُسۡمِعُ الصُّمَّ
We take thee away => نَذۡہَبَنَّ بِکَ
and you will be inquired about => وَسَوۡفَ تُسۡـَٔلُوۡنَ
beside the Gracious <em>God</em> => مِنۡ دُوۡنِ الرَّحۡمٰنِ
And We showed them no Sign => وَمَا نُرِیۡہِمۡ مِّنۡ اٰیَۃٍ
And Pharaoh proclaimed => وَنَادٰی فِرۡعَوۡنُ
under me => مِنۡ تَحۡتِیۡۤ
Do you not then see => اَفَلَا تُبۡصِرُوۡنَ
who is => الَّذِیۡ ہُوَ
and can scarcely express <em>himself </em>clearly => وَّلَا یَکَادُ یُبِیۡنُ
accompanied him => جَآءَ مَعَہُ
a wicked people => قَوۡمًا فٰسِقِیۡنَ
They mention not this to thee => مَا ضَرَبُوۡہُ لَکَ
a contentious people => قَوۡمٌ خَصِمُوۡنَ
He was only => اِنۡ ہُوَ اِلَّا
So have no doubt => فَلَا تَمۡتَرُنَّ
And let not Satan hinder you => وَلَا یَصُدَّنَّکُمُ الشَّیۡطٰنُ
But the parties differed => فَاخۡتَلَفَ الۡاَحۡزَابُ
They wait not but => ہَلۡ یَنۡظُرُوۡنَ اِلَّا
come suddenly upon them => تَاۡتِیَہُمۡ بَغۡتَۃً
to each other => بَعۡضُہُمۡ لِبَعۡضٍ
nor shall you grieve => وَلَاۤ اَنۡتُمۡ تَحۡزَنُوۡنَ
and submitted => وَکَانُوۡا مُسۡلِمِیۡنَ
and <I>in which </I>the eyes delight => وَتَلَذُّ الۡاَعۡیُنُ
And therein will you abide => وَاَنۡتُمۡ فِیۡہَا خٰلِدُوۡنَ
It will not be mitigated => لَا یُفَتَّرُ
will be seized therein with despair => فِیۡہِ مُبۡلِسُوۡنَ
let thy Lord finish with us => لِیَقۡضِ عَلَیۡنَا رَبُّکَ
We certainly brought you the truth => لَقَدۡ جِئۡنٰکُمۡ بِالۡحَقِّ
Have they determined => اَمۡ اَبۡرَمُوۡۤا
Do they think => اَمۡ یَحۡسَبُوۡنَ
and God on earth => وَّفِی الۡاَرۡضِ اِلٰہٌ
And those on whom they call beside Him possess no power => وَّلَا یَمۡلِکُ
a blessed Night => لَیۡلَۃٍ مُّبٰرَکَۃٍ
<I> By </I>Our <em>own </em>command => اَمۡرًا مِّنۡ عِنۡدِنَاۤ
have ever been sending => کُنَّا مُرۡسِلِیۡنَ

Deliver => اَنۡ اَدُّوۡۤا
exalt not yourselves => لَّا تَعۡلُوۡا
with a clear authority => بِسُلۡطٰنٍ مُّبِیۡنٍ
These are indeed a sinful people. => اَنَّ ہٰٓؤُلَآءِ قَوۡمٌ مُّجۡرِمُوۡنَ
Take My servants away by night => فَاَسۡرِ بِعِبَادِیۡ لَیۡلًا
you will surely be pursued => اِنَّکُمۡ مُّتَّبَعُوۡنَ
and the noble places => وَّمَقَامٍ کَرِیۡمٍ
And We made another people inherit these things => وَاَوۡرَثۡنٰہَا قَوۡمًا اٰخَرِیۡنَ
And the heaven and the earth wept not for them => فَمَا بَکَتۡ عَلَیۡہِمُ السَّمَآءُ وَالۡاَرۡضُ
the abasing torment => الۡعَذَابِ الۡمُہِیۡنِ
he was surely => اِنَّہٗ کَانَ
knowingly => عَلٰی عِلۡمٍ
some Signs => مِّنَ الۡاٰیٰتِ
wherein => مَا فِیۡہِ
a clear trial => بَلٰٓؤٌا مُّبِیۡنٌ
These => اِنَّ ہٰٓؤُلَآءِ
It is => اِنۡ ہِیَ
our first <em>and only </em>death => مَوۡتَتُنَا الۡاُوۡلٰی
And We created not => وَمَا خَلَقۡنَا
the appointed time for all of them => مِیۡقٰتُہُمۡ اَجۡمَعِیۡنَ
a friend shall not avail a friend => لَا یُغۡنِیۡ مَوۡلًی عَنۡ مَّوۡلًی
Surely\, He => اِنَّہٗ ہُوَ
They will not taste => لَا یَذُوۡقُوۡنَ
the first death => الۡمَوۡتَۃَ الۡاُوۡلٰی
he makes a jest of them => اتَّخَذَہَا ہُزُوًا
For such there is => اُولٰٓئِکَ لَہُمۡ
Before them => مِّنۡ وَّرَآئِہِمۡ
will not avail => لَنۡ یُّغۡنُوۡا
And Allah has created => وَخَلَقَ اللّٰہُ
and whom Allah has adjudged astray => وَاَضَلَّہُ اللّٰہُ
our present life => حَیَاتُنَا الدُّنۡیَا
clear Signs => اٰیٰتُنَا بَیِّنٰتٍ
the clear achievement => الۡفَوۡزُ الۡمُبِیۡنُ

we think it to be nothing => اِنۡ نَّظُنُّ
this day of yours => یَوۡمِکُمۡ ہٰذَا
they will not be taken out => لَا یُخۡرَجُوۡنَ
We have not created => مَا خَلَقۡنَا
and for an appointed term => وَاَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّی
will not answer => لَّا یَسۡتَجِیۡبُ
Our clear Signs => اٰیٰتُنَا بَیِّنٰتٍ
you cannot avail => فَلَا تَمۡلِکُوۡنَ
Sufficient is He => کَفٰی بِہٖ
Messenger => مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ
I do but follow => اِنۡ اَتَّبِعُ اِلَّا
from Allah => مِنۡ عِنۡدِ اللّٰہِ
they could not have been ahead of us => مَّا سَبَقُوۡنَاۤ
they have not been guided => لَمۡ یَہۡتَدُوۡا
And make my seed righteous => فِیۡ ذُرِّیَّتِیۡۤ
their good works => اَحۡسَنَ مَا عَمِلُوۡا
and overlook => وَنَتَجَاوَزُ عَنۡ
before me => مِنۡ قَبۡلِیۡ
cry unto Allah for help => یَسۡتَغِیۡثَانِ اللّٰہَ
that had gone => قَدۡ خَلَتۡ
there have been => وَقَدۡ خَلَتِ

and after him => وَمِنۡ خَلۡفِہٖۤ
everything => کُلَّ شَیۡءٍۭ
We have established you => مَّکَّنّٰکُمۡ فِیۡہِ
naught => مِّنۡ شَیۡءٍ
since they => اِذۡ کَانُوۡا
round about you => مَا حَوۡلَکُمۡ
townships => مِّنَ الۡقُرٰی
give life => اَنۡ یُّحۡیِۦَ
the Messengers => مِنَ الرُّسُلِ
and be in no haste => وَلَا تَسۡتَعۡجِل
the disobedient people => الۡقَوۡمُ الۡفٰسِقُوۡنَ
He renders their works vain => اَضَلَّ اَعۡمٰلَہُمۡ
He will never render => فَلَنۡ یُّضِلَّ
and will make your steps firm => وَیُثَبِّتۡ اَقۡدَامَکُمۡ
and He will make their works vain => وَاَضَلَّ اَعۡمٰلَہُمۡ
so He has made their works futile => فَاَحۡبَطَ اَعۡمٰلَہُمۡ
a township => مِّنۡ قَرۡیَۃٍ
more => ہِیَ اَشَدُّ
promised => الَّتِیۡ وُعِدَ
all => مِنۡ کُلِّ
Allah has sealed => طَبَعَ اللّٰہُ
and a kind word => وَّقَوۡلٌ مَّعۡرُوۡفٌ
Would you then => فَہَلۡ عَسَیۡتُمۡ
create disorder => اَنۡ تُفۡسِدُوۡا
and makes their eyes blind => وَاَعۡمٰۤی اَبۡصٰرَہُمۡ
Will they not\, then\, ponder => اَفَلَا یَتَدَبَّرُوۡنَ
their backs => عَلٰۤی اَدۡبٰرِہِمۡ
become manifest => مَا تَبَیَّنَ
holds out to them false hopes => وَاَمۡلٰی لَہُمۡ
So He rendered their works vain => فَاَحۡبَطَ اَعۡمٰلَہُمۡ
shall not harm => لَنۡ یَّضُرُّوا
and He will make their works fruitless => وَّسَیُحۡبِطُ اَعۡمٰلَہُمۡ
certainly will not forgive => فَلَنۡ یَّغۡفِرَ
and He will not deprive you => وَلَنۡ یَّتِرَکُمۡ
and will not ask of you => وَلَا یَسۡـَٔلۡکُمۡ
past => مَا تَقَدَّمَ
thy shortcomings => مِنۡ ذَنۡۢبِکَ

crying => فِیۡ صَرَّۃٍ
And We found not => فَمَا وَجَدۡنَا
that it visited => اَتَتۡ عَلَیۡہِ
And they were not able => فَمَا اسۡتَطٰعُوۡا
before <em>them</em> => مِّنۡ قَبۡلُ
they were => اِنَّہُمۡ کَانُوۡا

And I have not created => وَمَا خَلَقۡتُ

Who => الَّذِیۡنَ ہُمۡ

Is this then magic => اَفَسِحۡرٌ ہٰذَاۤ
you show <em>it </em>not => لَا تَصۡبِرُوۡا
And We will not diminish => وَمَاۤ اَلَتۡنٰہُمۡ

to one another => بَعۡضُہُمۡ عَلٰی بَعۡضٍ
they would not believe => لَّا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ
