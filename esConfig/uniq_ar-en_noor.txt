to try
they argued
then thou didst breathe
may benefit him
and you will become
for then you will turn
We had tried him
persecute
to emigrate
wake up
turn you therefore
then put thy trust
So put thy trust
put your trust
So turn thou away
So turn away
Therefore turn thou away
So they went away
Then <em>Salih </em>turned away
Then he turned away
withdrew
But he turned away
in various ways
a young man
her slave-boy
two young men
young men
your maids
a whit
betake yourselves
so give firmness
So He kept them back
there
and brought
and they brought them
wide
and they penetrated
are made to flow forth
its compensation
his reward shall
He has in fact ordained for you
Then He made
then you made
We turned
and We shall scatter it
so We made him
And We placed it
Thus We made it
We render it
but We made them
and We made them
so We made them
And made them
So he broke them
And <em>thus </em>made them
and has made for him
and made him
Then turns it
and concerted
were assembled
Then shall We gather them
spacious hollow
wrong for it
encompassed
proclaim
a foul deed
a foul thing
And he gathered
becomes due
justified
with the result
So she conceived him
but they acted unfaithfully towards them
So take hold
so take
So hold them
then accept it
take it
then seize them
so that the roof fell down
But the reward
Then he came forth
So he went forth
and we feared
Then there has come
Then there came
then He shaped
then We fashioned
then leave
boastful
boaster
ransom
and entered
Then he prayed
prayed
Then they will call on them
And they will call upon them
and then crushed in
So he caused them to fall
destroyed
and We destroy it
then We destroyed them
an expiation
ransom
So it tasted
So they tasted
Then they slaughtered her
So leave Me
so leave them
so leave them alone
So leave her
so let her alone
So admonish
Admonish then
So go on reminding
Admonish
That
That is the one
Such is
And this
So these
Taste\, then
Then taste
taste therefore
Taste then
so now taste
So taste ye
Taste ye
taste it then
so that he looks upon it
and see him
and they saw it
<em>and</em> sweet
sweet
sweet
in fright
to flee away
flee
Then he went secretly
Then he began suddenly
he went
the parting
and your Lord
Fleeing
faeces
then <i>say your Prayer</i> on foot
is rent asunder
returned
So We restored thee
Then they turned
then a man
her chastity
her private parts
rejoiced
he rejoices
they became exultant
they rejoice
they exulted
rejoicing
Jubilant
all alone
singly
childless
Thus did We restore him
one by one
you flee
carpets
a bed
We have spread out
made incumbent
have settled
We have enjoined
exceeds all bounds
my remissness
you failed in your duty
our neglecting
We have left out
Pharaoh
Pharaoh
became free
thou art free
part
fully
a distinction
section
caused a division
We have revealed in pieces
split up
with great skill
flaws
their private parts
their chastity
their private parts
Then <em>for him </em>is comfort
strange
a dowry
<em>This</em> fixing <em>of portions</em>
as fixed
an ordinance
a party
a section
some
a party
a section
some
a part
any party
they treated some
a party
two parties
it increases their
it adds
has increased their
but this <i>only</i> increased
and they <em>thus</em> increased
so add to him
terror
are relieved of fright
they will be smitten with fear
Then We shall separate
<em>appear</em> beautiful
made <em>to appear</em> attractive
and evil
and evil was
it shall be an evil
so I will ordain it
for creating disorder
create disorder
disorder
corruption
And he cast lots
But glorify
glorify
So glorify
Glorified then
So glorify
So Holy
do thou glorify Him
And thou wilt soon see
So you will soon remember
and you will know
Then will you know
And you will soon know
and they <i>all</i> submitted
and they <em>all </em>submitted
and they all submitted
but far away
So We subjected
disobedience
profane
then do We drive them
disobedient
rebel
disobedient
perfidious
were disobedient
wicked
rebellious
So he watered
rebellious
disobedient
ask
but ask
So ask
Ask thou then
Then ‘Peace
salute
and ask him
so ask those
So ask
But ask them
ask them
We will facilitate for him
We will make easy for him
We shall soon
soon
then <em>let it be known that in his stead</em>
but soon
but you shall soon
then
we shall certainly
and <I>the punishment of your rejection </I>
But they will soon
and soon
shall be disobedience
and perfected
and perfects
then perfected thee
and made it perfect
and made it (destruction
and He perfected them
but soon there will come to them
He will surely give him
He will gather them
So go about
He will surely admit them
so travel
will surely see
they will realize
and soon they will know
They will say
Then will they ask
Then they will say
They will then shake
They will surely continue to spend it
bind fast
And will drink
Drinking
you became lax
the evidence
then let fall
He replied\, ‘Nay\, but your souls have embellished to you this thing. So <em>now </em>comely patience <I>is good for me</I>
then she has spoken the truth
and has thus hindered them
and thus turned them away
and turn <em>men </em>away
and they turn <em>men </em>away
thus they turn <em>men </em>away
and turned away
and make them attached
and smote
So pray
He has already explained
departed
expounded in detail
have been expounded in detail
We have explained
which We have expounded
We have explained
and offers Prayers
should fast

silver
and she <em>too </em>was frightened
smite
Then there will be set up
So We sealed

He has exalted you
exalted us

His grace

given them of His bounty

and have thus gone astray
Thus they have gone astray
visited
was prolonged
So a seal was set
created
He has created
the nature made
created you
created us
created me
created me
made them
Then he began
divorce them
We blinded
purify
flaw
rough
will bow ...
then you would keep
but they unjustly rejected
and they began
and he thought
and realize
then when you retaliate
then punish
bring about
Doer
But they rebelled
then wondrous
and He has given
the same number
then <em>know that </em>the prescribed period for them
then proportioned thee aright
and he knew them
We strengthened
Maybe
Perhaps
it may be
maybe
And they disobeyed
disobeyed
admonish them
but We pardoned
and hamstrung
Then they hamstrung
But they hamstrung her
and hamstrung her
have done

thou didst so
hast done
thou didst

I did do it
I did it
and He knew
But He knew
Then they will know
they do
We dealt
done this
they commit
have done
had done
which they committed
they have done
on me
then it is your duty
must do something
do something
to do

Who do
perform it
then in Him
will bear
suffer
on him
it is to his own harm
against it
does so to its detriment
on them
they shall have
so they became blind
has been rendered obscure
but with
with
So that there covered them
overwhelmed them
So He forgave
So We forgave
Thus were they vanquished
and fetter him
so his life became miserable
We opened
then We opened them
<i>should make</i> an expiation
So I fled
Flee ye therefore
some
will be struck with terror
and he was afraid
and he disobeyed
but they transgress
they will be

and He multiplied you

then she has lied
but we treated <em>him </em>as a liar
aye\, they rejected
But they accused him of falsehood
But they rejected him
but they treated him as a liar
So they rejected him
So they declared him to be a liar
But they called him a liar
So they called them liars
and they rejected them both
likewise
reflected
Certainly you would loathe it
then We clothed
and removed
now We have removed
but He withheld

The expiation for this
but they disbelieved
So they disbelieved

Fighting therein is <i>a</i> great <i>transgression</i>

Allah make His commandments clear to you
Upon this world
concerning the orphans
Promotion of their welfare is <i>an act of</i> great goodness
Allah had so willed
And marry not
even a believing bond-woman
than an idolatress
although she may <i>highly</i> please you
And give not <i>believing women</i> in marriage to idolaters until they believe
<i>even</i> a believing slave is better than an idolater
although he may <i>highly</i> please you
And He makes His Signs clear
It is a harmful thing
and go not in unto them
as Allah has commanded you
Allah loves those who turn to Him
Your wives are a tilth
and send ahead <i>some good</i> for yourselves
And make not Allah
that you may <i>thereby</i> abstain from doing good
Allah will not call you to account
for such of your oaths as are vain

vow <i>abstinence</i> from their wives

that they cannot observe

And the man
No soul is burdened beyond its capacity
The mother shall not make <i>the father</i> suffer on account of her child
nor shall he to whom the child belongs make <i>the mother</i> suffer on account of his child
and the same is incumbent on the heir
If they both decide upon weaning <i>the child</i> by mutual consent and consultation
there is no blame
there shall be no blame on you
provided you pay what you have agreed to pay
sees what you do
of you who die
and leave wives behind
four months and ten <i>days</i>
no sin shall lie
with regard to themselves
is aware of what you do
throwing out a hint regarding a proposal of marriage to <i>these</i> women
in keeping <i>the desire</i> hidden in your minds
Allah knows that you will think of them <i>in this connection</i>
you say a fair word
And resolve not on
the marriage tie
the prescribed period reaches
It shall be no sin
while you have not touched them
nor settled
the rich man
and the poor man
before
you have touched them
then half of what you have settled <i>shall be due from you</i>
unless they remit
or he\, in whose hand is the tie of marriage\, should remit
And that you should remit is nearer
Allah sees what you do
and the middle Prayer
If you are in <i>a state of</i> fear
you did not
And those of you who die
and leave behind wives
provision for a year without <i>their</i> being turned out
But if they <i>themselves</i> go out
there shall be no blame upon you
in regard to any proper thing which they do concerning themselves
And for the divorced women <i>also</i> there should be a provision according to what is fair
Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to you
Dost thou not know
And Allah said to them
is Munificent
are not grateful
is it that
a goodly loan
manifold
Hast thou not heard
of the chiefs
of the children of Israel
after Moses
that you will not fight
that you will not fight
What reason have we to abstain from fighting
fighting was ordained for them
And their Prophet said to them
Allah has appointed
can he have sovereignty
and he is not given
The sign of his sovereignty
there shall be given you a heart
wherein there will be tranquillity
and a legacy <i>of good</i> left by the family of Moses

Talut set out

But they drank of it\, except a few of them
We have no power
But those who knew for certain that they would <i>one day</i> meet Allah said
How many a small party

And when they issued forth to <i>encounter</i> Jalut and his forces

and make our steps firm
the disbelieving people
by the command of Allah
and David slew Jalut
and Allah gave him
And had it not been for Allah’s repelling
the earth would have become filled with disorder
But Allah is Munificent to <i>all</i> peoples
These are the Signs of Allah
thou art one of the Messengers
Allah spoke
and some of them He exalted
son of Mary
with the Spirit of holiness
And if Allah had <i>so</i> willed
those <i>that came</i> after them would not have fought with one another
after clear Signs had come to them
they would not have fought with one another
before
the day comes
wherein there shall be no buying and selling
and it is those who disbelieve that do wrong to themselves
but He
Slumber seizes Him not
nor sleep
Who is he that will
before them
and they encompass nothing
His knowledge extends
and the care of them burdens Him not
There should be no compulsion in religion
right has become distinct from wrong
a strong handle which knows no breaking
He brings them out of every <i>kind of</i> darkness into light
who bring them out of light into every <i>kind of</i> darkness
therein shall they
Allah had given him
Abraham said
I <i>also</i> give life and cause death
bring it thou
Thereupon the infidel was dumbfounded
guides not
the unjust people
Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years
How long hast thou remained <i>in this state</i>
thou hast remained <i>in this state</i> for a hundred years
they have not rotted
And <i>We have done this</i> that We may make thee a Sign unto men
clothe them with flesh
has the power to do all that He wills
Hast thou not believe
but <i>I ask this</i> that my heart may be at rest
Take four birds
put each of them on a hill
And Allah multiplies <i>it</i> further
for the cause
follow not up
taunt or injury
and they shall have no fear
A kind word
render not vain
to be seen of men
and he believes not
His case is like the case
a smooth rock <i>covered</i> with earth
on which heavy rain falls
They shall not secure
aught of what
the disbelieving people
their souls
Heavy rain falls on it
heavy rain does not fall on it\, then light rain <i>suffices</i>
Does any of you desire
with streams flowing beneath it
and with all kinds of fruit for him therein
while old age has stricken him
and he has weak offspring
and that a fiery whirlwind should smite it and it be <i>all</i> burnt
Thus does Allah make His Signs clear to you
that you may ponder
and seek not what is bad
to spend out of it
when you would not take it yourselves
to whom He pleases
abundant good
or whatsoever vow you vow
Allah surely knows it
and for the wrongdoers there shall be no helpers
you give alms openly
it is well <i>and good</i>
it is better
and He will remove from you <i>many</i> of your sins
aware of what you do
of wealth you spend
it is for yourselves
while you spend not
of wealth you spend
it shall be paid back to you in full
and are unable
The ignorant man thinks them
to be free from want because of <i>their</i> abstaining <i>from begging</i>
they do not beg
has perfect knowledge thereof
on them <i>shall come</i> no fear
nor shall they grieve
Satan has smitten with insanity
Trade <i>also</i> is like interest
whereas Allah has made trade lawful
and made interest unlawful
an admonition comes
then will that <i>which he received</i> in the past be his
And those who revert <i>to it</i>
the inmates of the Fire
therein shall they abide
Allah will abolish
and will cause charity to increase
loves not anyone who is
and observe Prayer
and pay the Zakat
and no fear <i>shall come</i> on them
But if you do <i>it</i> not
have your original sums
<i>thus</i> you shall not wrong
nor shall you be wronged
And if any <i>debtor</i> be in straitened circumstances
then <i>grant him</i> respite till a time of ease
when you shall be made to return
shall every soul be paid in full
you borrow one from another
fixed period
And let a scribe write <i>it</i> in your presence faithfully
scribe should refuse
Allah has taught him
who
and let him who incurs the liability dictate
and he should fear Allah
diminish anything therefrom
the person
unable
himself to dictate
then let someone who can watch his interest dictate
And call two witnesses
from among your men
and if two men be not <i>available</i>
so that if either of two <i>women</i> should err <i>in memory</i>
then one may remind the other
And the witnesses should not refuse
when they are called
along with its appointed time <i>of payment</i>
in the sight of Allah
and makes testimony surer
and is more likely to keep you away from doubts; <i>therefore omit not to write</i>
except that it be ready merchandise
which you give or take from hand to hand
in which case it shall be no sin for you
that you write it not
And have witnesses when you sell one to another
And if you do <i>that</i>
And Allah grants you knowledge
and Allah knows all things well
and you find not
then let there be a pledge with possession
And if one of you entrusts another with something
then let him who is entrusted surrender his trust
and let him fear Allah
And conceal not testimony
his heart is certainly sinful
And Allah is well aware of what you do
Allah will call you to account for it
and Allah has the power to do all that He wills
This Messenger <i>of Ours</i> believes
all <i>of them</i> believe in Allah
<i>saying</i>\, ‘We make no distinction between any of His Messengers
We hear\, and we obey. <i>We implore</i> Thy forgiveness
O our Lord\, and to Thee is the returning
Allah burdens not any soul
beyond its capacity
It shall have <i>the reward</i> it earns
and it shall get <i>the punishment</i> it incurs
and our Lord\, lay not
before us
burden us not
with what we have not the strength to bear
and efface our <i>sins</i>
and grant us forgiveness
Allah is He beside Whom there is no God
containing the truth <em>and</em> fulfilling that which precedes it
Before <em>this</em>
a severe punishment
Possessor of the power to requite
after Thou hast guided us
there is no doubt
the fuel of the Fire
those before them
whom they saw to be twice as many as themselves
In that surely is a lesson
love of desired things
and pastured horses
That is the provision of the present life
than that
For those who fear God
there are Gardens with their Lord
beneath which rivers flow
therein shall they abide
and pure spouses
and Allah’s pleasure
we do believe
the punishment of the Fire
Allah bears witness
that there is no God but
there is no God but
And those who were given the Book did not disagree
but after
knowledge had come to them
out of mutual envy
the Signs of Allah
unjustly
such men
and they shall have no helpers
in aversion
And what they used to forge has deceived them
and when every soul shall be paid in full
Thou makest the night pass
and makest the day pass
And Allah cautions you
Allah did
with one another
and the male <em>she was thinking of</em> was not like the female <em>
So her Lord accepted her
did Zachariah pray
And the angels called to him
shall I have
that thou shalt not speak
And thou wast not
the right path
and Allah <em>also</em> planned
a severe punishment
and they shall have no
He will pay them their full rewards
and the wise Reminder
so be thou not
that we worship none
and that we associate no partner
and that some of us take not
when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed
after him
and he was not
only they perceive not
the believers
And obey none
We are not liable to blame
take a paltry price in exchange for <em>their</em> covenant with Allah and their oaths
and Allah will neither speak to them
while it is not
while it is not
not to Allah
Do they seek a religion other than
We make no distinction
and to Him we submit
it shall not be accepted
shall Allah guide
and to whom clear proofs had come
wrongdoing people
Their punishment
thereafter
their repentance shall not be accepted
there shall not be accepted
an earthful
after this
then it
that Allah is surely
and His Messenger is present among you
is indeed guided
and be not divided
so that by His grace you became <em>as</em> brothers
does Allah explain
and some faces shall be black
faces will be black
those whose faces will be white
and Allah wills not any
shall all affairs be returned
it would have surely been better
They cannot harm you
Then they shall not be helped
and prostrate themselves
they shall not be denied
And Allah has not wronged them
they will not fail to corrupt you
you are those who love them
but they love you not
will not harm you
two of your groups
should the believers rely
So take Allah for your Protector
Will it not suffice you
and that your hearts might be at rest
from
Thou hast no
He may turn to them in mercy
and do not persist
and that Allah may distinguish
And that Allah may purify
while Allah has not yet distinguished
And he who turns back
And Allah will certainly reward
by Allah’s leave
And they uttered not a word
So Allah gave them
And Allah had surely made good to you
and looked not back
that you might not grieve
<em>like unto</em>
we should not have been killed
and that Allah might test
when the two hosts met
they would not have died
that Allah may make
Allah help you
then\, let the believers put their trust
And it is not possible
shall every soul be fully paid
shall not be wronged
before that
and you had inflicted
when the two parties met
was by Allah’s command
they would not have been slain
Think not of those
which Allah has given them
have not yet joined
because on them <em>shall come</em> no fear
suffers not the reward of the believers to be los
shall have a great reward
It is Satan who only frightens
so fear them not
a severe punishment
a great reward
those\, who are niggardly
which fire devours
There have already come to you
before thee
and the shining Book
an illusory enjoyment
think not that
suffer a grievous chastisement
Thou hast not created
him hast Thou surely disgraced
And the wrongdoers shall have no
forgive us\, therefore
and disgrace us not
You are from one anothe
through which
and with Allah
a single soul
and from them twain spread many
and exchange not
and devour not
a great sin
that you will not be fair in dealing
you will not deal justly
And give not
Allah has made
words of kind advice
until they attain <em>the age of</em>

against their growing up
and whoso is
then call witnesses in their presence
And Allah is sufficient
whether it be little
or much
<em>other</em> relations
And let those fear <em>God</em> who

the property of orphans
fire into their bellies
Allah commands you
concerning your children

they have no child

or a woman whose heritage is to be divided and he <em>or she</em> has neither parent nor child
than that
which may have been bequeathed
are the limits <em>set</em> by Allah
through which streams flow
is a great triumph
therein shall he abide
an humiliating punishment
And those of your women who are guilty of lewdness
four of you against them
death overtake them
Allah open
from among you are guilty of it
then leave them alone
Verily\, Allah undertakes to accept the repentance of only
soon after
they to whom Allah turns with mercy
and Allah is
There is no <i>acceptance of</i>
repentance for those who <i>continue to</i> do evil until
when death faces one of them
nor for those who die disbelievers
It is these for whom We have prepared
a painful punishment
it is not lawful
wherein Allah has placed
much good
take not aught therefrom
and with manifest sinfulness
one of you has been alone
with the other
a strong covenant
and brother’s daughters
and sister’s daughters
and your <em>foster</em>-mothers that have given you suck
and your foster-sisters
and the mothers of your wives
who are your wards
by your wives unto
you have gone in
you have not
gone in unto them
there shall be no sin upon you
to have two sisters together <em>in marriage</em>
has already passed
And <em>forbidden to you are</em> married women
your right hands possess
This has Allah enjoined on you
are those beyond that
that you seek <em>them</em> by means of your property
benefit you receive from them
and there shall be no sin
after the fixing <em>of the dowry</em>
of you cannot
marry free
believing women
<em>let him</em> marry what your right hands possess
namely\, your believing handmaids
you are <em>all</em> one from another
taking secret paramours
they are guilty
the punishment prescribed for free women
yourselves is better for you
and to turn to you in mercy
to turn to you in mercy
but those who follow <em>their</em> low desires wish that you should stray far away
but those who follow <em>their</em> low desires wish that you should stray far away
Allah desires
for man has been created weak
devour not
except that <em>you earn</em> by trade with mutual consent
And kill not
Merciful to you
We shall cast him into Fire
and that is
easy with Allah
If you keep away from the more grievous of the things which are forbidden you
are forbidden you
We will remove from you your <em>minor</em> evils and admit you to a place of great honour
And covet not
whereby Allah has made some of you excel others
has perfect knowledge of all things
the parents and the relations leave
and <em>also</em> those with whom your oaths have ratified a contract
Allah watches over all things
Allah has made some of them excel others
So virtuous women <em>are those who</em> are obedient
and guard the secrets <em>of their husbands</em> with Allah’s protection
And <em>as for</em> those on whose part you fear disobedience
alone in their beds
seek not
a way against them
reconciliation
Allah and associate naught with Him
and <em>show</em> kindness to parents\, and to kindred\, and orphans
Surely\, Allah loves not the proud <em>and</em> the boastful
an humiliating punishment
and believe not
the Last Day
<em>let him remember that</em> an evil companion is he
And what <em>harm</em> would have befallen them
Allah has given them
And Allah knows them full well
Surely\, Allah wrongs not <em>any one even</em> by the weight of an atom
And how <em>will it fare with them</em> when We shall bring a witness from every people
as a witness against these
those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish
that the earth were made level with them
and they shall not <em>be able to</em> conceal anything from Allah
O ye who believe
approach not Prayer
when you are not in <em>full</em> possession of your senses
until you know what you say
when you are travelling along a way
And if you are ill
or <em>you are</em> on a journey <em>while unclean</em>
or <em>if</em> one of you comes from the privy
or you have touched women and you find no water
then betake yourselves to pure dust
They buy error
and desire that you <em>too</em> may lose the way
knows your enemies full well
And sufficient is Allah as a Friend
and sufficient is Allah as a Helper
There are some among the Jews
who pervert words from their <em>proper</em> places
And they say\, ‘We hear and we disobey\,
and ‘hear <em>thou</em> without being heard
and ‘Ra‘ina\,’ screening with their tongues <em>what is in their minds</em> and <em>seeking</em> to injure the Faith
And if they had said
We hear and we obey
and ‘hear <em>thou</em>\,’ and ‘Unzurna
it would have been better for them and more upright
Allah has cursed them
of the Book! believe in what We have sent down
before We destroy <em>some of</em> the leaders and turn them on their backs
And the decree of Allah is <em>bound</em> to be carried out
will not forgive
a very great sin
hold themselves to be pure
Who purifies whomsoever
and they will not be wronged
a lie against Allah
as a manifest sin
They believe in evil things and <em>follow</em> those who transgress
in religion than those who believe
Allah has cursed
Allah curses
thou shalt not find for him a helper
Have they a share in the kingdom
Then would they not give men <i>even so much as</i> the little hollow in the back of a date-stone
Or do they envy men
and We <em>also</em> gave them a great kingdom
We shall soon cause them to enter Fire
their skins are burnt up
therein shall they have
pure spouses
and We shall admit them to a <em>place of</em> pleasant and plenteous shade
you judge with justice
And surely excellent is that with which Allah admonishes you
and obey <em>His</em> Messenger and those who are in authority among you
And if you differ in anything among yourselves
refer it to Allah and <em>His</em> Messenger
if you are believers in Allah and the Last Day
Dost thou not know of those
has been revealed to thee
not to obey them
And Satan desires
lead them far astray
Come ye to what Allah has sent down
and to <em>His</em> Messenger\,
an affliction befalls them
their hands have sent on before them
they come to thee swearing by Allah
These are they
the secrets of whose hearts Allah knows well
an effective word concerning their own selves
And We have sent no Messenger
And if they had come to thee when they had wronged their souls\, and asked forgiveness of Allah\, and <em>if</em> the Messenger <em>also</em> had asked forgiveness for them\, they would have surely found Allah Oft-Returning <em>with compassion and</em> Merciful
they are not believres
then find not
We had commanded
Kill your people
your homes
they would not have done it
they are exhorted to do
a great reward from Ourself
in the right path
And whoso obeys Allah and this Messenger <em>of His</em> shall be among those on whom Allah has bestowed His blessings
namely\, the Prophets
And excellent companions are these
a misfortune befall you
Allah has been gracious
since I was not present with them
as if there were no love between you and him
Would that I had been with them
then should I have indeed achieved a great success
a great reward
And what is the matter with you <em>that</em> you fight not in the cause of Allah
men\, women and children
who say
whose people are oppressors
some friend from Thyself
Fight ye therefore against the friends of Satan
Satan’s strategy
it was said
fighting has been prescribed for them
Thou prescribed fighting for us
respite yet a while
The benefit of this world is little
and the Hereafter will be better for him who fears <em>God</em>
and you shall not be wronged a whit
death will overtake you
strongly built towers
some good befalls them
evil befalls them
What has happened to these people that they come not near
of good comes to thee
of evil befalls thee
as a Messenger to mankind
obeys Allah indeed
as a keeper over them
Obedience <em>is our guiding principle</em>;’ but when they go forth from thy presence
a section of them
spends the night scheming against what thou sayest
and put <em>thy</em> trust in Allah
And sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of affairs
Had it been from
much disagreement
And when there comes to them any tidings <i>whether</i> of peace or of fear
they had referred it
those in authority
surely those of them\, who can elicit <i>the truth from</i> it\, would have understood it
for the grace of Allah
you would have followed Satan\, save a few
thou art not made responsible
a righteous intercession
shall have
an evil intercession
Powerful over everything
greet ye with a better prayer or <em>at least</em> return it
Surely\, Allah takes account of all things
Allah is He beside Whom there is none worthy of worship
He will certainly <em>continue to</em> assemble you till the Day of Resurrection
about which there is no doubt
in his word than Allah
that you are divided into two parties regarding the hypocrites
to guide him whom Allah has caused to perish
Allah causes to perish
thou shalt not find a way
They wish that
Take not
therefore\, friends from among them
emigrate in the way of Allah
and take no
friend nor helper from among them
while their hearts shrink
And if Allah had so pleased
and fight you not
and make you an offer
then <em>remember that</em> Allah has allowed you no way <em>of aggression</em> against them
Whenever they are made to revert
if they do not keep aloof from you
nor offer you peace nor restrain their hands
Against these We have given you clear authority
a believing slave
and <em>pay</em> blood money to be handed over to his heirs
they remit it as charity
But if <em>the person slain</em> be of a people hostile to you
then <em>the offender</em> shall free a believing slave
then <em>the offender shall pay</em> blood money to be handed over to his heirs
But whoso finds not <em>one</em>\, then he shall fast for two consecutive months
wherein he shall abide
And Allah will be wroth
a great punishment
the goods of this life
before this
but Allah conferred His <em>special</em> favour on you
Surely\, Allah is
well aware of what you do
are not equal
Those of the believers who sit <em>still</em>\, excepting the disabled ones
and those who strive in the cause of Allah
with their wealth and their persons
Allah has exalted in rank those who strive
above those who sit <em>still</em>
And to each Allah has promised good
And Allah has exalted those who strive
above those who sit <em>still</em>
by a great reward
<em>Namely\, by</em> degrees of excellence <em>bestowed</em> by Him
and <em>by special</em> forgiveness and mercy
angels cause to die
What were you after
Was not Allah’s earth
and an evil destination it is
as are incapable of adopting any plan or of finding any way
efface their sins
for Allah is the Effacer of sins\, <em>and is</em> Most Forgiving
from his country in the cause of Allah
an abundant place of refuge and plentifulness
forth from his home
emigrating in the cause of Allah and His Messenger
and death overtakes him
his reward lies on Allah
sin on you
shorten the Prayer
those who disbelieve may give you trouble
an open enemy to you
the Prayer for them
let a party of them stand
and let another party\, who have
not yet prayed
The disbelievers wish
that they may fall upon you
And it shall be no sin on you
you are in
But you should <i>always</i> take your means of defence
an humiliating punishment for the disbelievers
And when you have finished the Prayer
remember Allah while standing
and <em>lying</em> on your sides
And when you are secure <em>from danger</em>
then observe Prayer <em>in the prescribed form</em>
verily Prayer is enjoined on the believers
<em>to be performed</em> at fixed hours
And slacken not
what they hope not
We have surely sent down
And be not thou
And plead not
but they cannot hide
He does not approve
the present life
And Allah is All-Knowing
and a manifest sin
And they ruin none
and they cannot harm thee
at all
Allah will
strayed
beside Him
and they invoke none
suffered a manifest loss
and Satan promises them nothing
and they shall find no
beneath which
and he shall find for himself no friend
good works
And Allah took
And people are prone to
And you cannot keep
But incline not wholly
out of
And We have assuredly commanded
Therefore follow not
believe
has surely strayed
Give to the hypocrites the tidings
being denied
Were we not
Did we not get the better of you
and Allah will not grant
and they remember
thou shalt not find
and thou shalt find no
And Allah will soon bestow
should Allah punish you
ou are thankful and <em>if</em> you believe
the uttering of unseemly speech in public
an evil
in between
disbelievers
and make no distinction
ask thee to cause a Book to descend
Then a destructive punishment overtook them
had come to them
so they believe not
We did kill
whereas they slew him not
he was made to appear to them like
knowledge
and they did not convert this <em>conjecture</em> into
the Jews
after him
already
and Allah spoke
so that people may have no
plea against Allah
have certainly strayed
easy for Allah
O People of the Book
He should have
Surely\, the Messiah will never
nor will the angels
He will give them their rewards in full
And they shall find for themselves beside Allah no
clear light
she has
and Allah knows all things well
but help not one another
I perfected your religion for you
of the Book
and in the Hereafter he
and you find not
Allah’s favour
to act otherwise than with justice
their hands against you
And on Allah
twelve
And Allah said
the right path
And thou wilt not cease
And Allah will soon let them know
and a clear Book
The Jews and the Christians say
the Holy Land
turn back
there is in that <em>land</em> a haughty and powerful people
so long as they
therefore make Thou a distinction between us
the rebellious people
So grieve not
and was not accepted
I am not going to stretch out
But his mind induced him
Then Allah sent
to be
regretful
On account of
yet even
and in the Hereafter they shall have
in your power
if those who disbelieve had
it would not be accepted
but they will not
a lasting punishment
then will Allah surely
turn to him in mercy
Dost thou not know
but their hearts believe not
for <em>conveying it to</em> another people
thou shalt not avail
has not been pleased
and certainly they will not believe
Therefore fear not
and barter not
And therein We prescribed for them
before him
before it
And let the People of the Gospel judge
and follow not their evil inclinations
shall you all return
which Allah has revealed
Do they then seek the judgment of <em>the days of</em> Ignorance
will bring about
And those who believe will say
with their most solemn oaths
they were surely with you
and will not fear
Allah’s grace
because
previously
and on whom His wrath has fallen
and of whom He has made
and go out
And if
thou hast not conveyed
whereas the Messiah <em>himself </em>said
forbidden
and the Fire will be his resort
And the wrongdoers shall have no helpers
Allah
One God
they do not desist
Will they not then turn
The Messiah
before him
We explain the Signs for their good
beside
has no power
And it is Allah Who
exceed not the limits in <em>the matter of</em> your religion unjustly
who went astray
and caused many to go astray
they would not have taken them as <em>their</em>
because of the truth which they have recognized
and in the truth which has come to us
the righteous people
So Allah rewarded them
make not unlawful
Allah
for the oaths which you take in earnest
they fear
the game
which your hands and your lances can reach
so that Allah may distinguish those
two just men

And there comes not to them

they would not have been granted a respite
but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed
Who feeds

And be thou not

He has power to do all that He wills
And this Qur’an has been revealed to me
so that with it I may warn you
I bear not witness <em>thereto</em>
He is the One God

Why\, then\, when Our punishment came upon them\, did they not

And We send not

for whomsoever He pleases
Verily He
you shall not be helped
comes upon you
thou didst treat them as lies
And Allah will deliver
the righteous
shall not touch them
Is it other <em>gods </em>than Allah
And they do not esteem Allah
And the trumpet will be blown
and <em>all </em>who are in the heavens
And the earth will shine
and the Book will be laid
and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought
And every soul will be fully rewarded
And those who disbelieve will be driven

And those who feared their Lord will be conducted

and its Keepers say to them

And Allah judges
but those on whom they call
Allah is the All-Hearing\, the All-Seeing
Have they not travelled
those
They were
But Allah seized them
and they had no protector against Allah
so Allah seized them
Surely He is Powerful
And We did send
And when he came to them
from Us
and let their women live
And a believing man
because he says
one who is
I only point out to you
And he who believed said
the day of mutual calling
No defender shall you have against Allah
And for him whom Allah adjudges astray shall be no guide
but you ceased not
Allah will never raise up
does Allah adjudge as lost
those who
and the design of Pharaoh ended in nothing but ruin
this life of the world is but a <em>temporary </em>provision
and the Hereafter is certainly
the home for permanent stay
will be requited only with the like of it
and is a believe
how <em>strange</em>
Surely
to which you call me
has no <em>title </em>to be called upon
the transgressors
The result was that Allah preserved him
and a grievous punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh
Cast Pharaoh’s people into the severest punishment
will you then relieve us of
a portion of the Fire
Allah has already judged between <em>His </em>servants
And those in the Fire will say
that He may lighten for us
the punishment for a <em>single </em>day
Did not
is of no avail
Most surely We help
in the present life
will not profit
and made the children of Israel the inheritors of the Book
Those who dispute
which they will never attain
And the blind and the seeing are not equal
and do good deeds
do you reflect
The Hour will surely come
And your Lord says
It is Allah Who
Verily\, Allah is the Lord of bounty
to worship
a term appointed
and that you may learn wisdom
those who
But soon will they come to know
When the iron-collars
you associated
we never prayed to anything before
Thus will Allah confound
you behaved insolently
Allah’s decree
and then there perished
and eat of some of them
and that\, by means of them\, you may satisfy any desire
But all that which they earned was of no avail to them
in the knowledge which they possessed
And that at which they mocked encompassed them
which we used to associate with Him
But their faith could not profit them
Allah’s law
that has <em>ever </em>been in operation
And thus have perished
the Qur’an in clear\, eloquent language
But most of them turn away
and between us
that your God is One God
they will surely have a reward that will never end
therein firm mountains

in two days
each heaven
before them
and behind them
Worship none
a furious wind
for several ominous days
will not be helped
so the calamity of a humiliating punishment seized them
on account of what they had earned
and acted righteously
they will be goaded on
when
they had been doing
Allah has made us to speak
And you did not fear
your ears and your eyes and your skins
their abode
gone
Surely\, they were <em>the</em> losers
Listen not
but make noise during its <em>recital </em>
And most certainly We will make those who disbelieve taste
for the worst of their deeds
there will be an abiding home therein
And those who disbelieve will say
Therein you will have
and does good works
And good and evil are not alike
And lo\, he between whom and thyself
will become as though he were a warm friend
a large share of good
Prostrate not yourselves
And among His Signs
that thou seest
can quicken the dead
are not hidden from Us
Is he\, then\, who is cast
when it comes to them
And\, truly\, it is a mighty Book
Falsehood cannot approach it
from before
Nothing is said
what was said
Thy Lord is indeed the Master
Qur’an in a foreign tongue
Why have not its verses been made clear
What! a foreign tongue and an Arab
It is a guidance and a healing for those who believe
But <em>as to those</em> who believe not
there is a deafness in their ears
They are\, <em>as it were</em>\, being called to
And We did give Moses the Book
and certainly they are in a disquieting doubt about it
And thy Lord is not at all
unjust to <em>His </em>servants
And no fruits come forth
does any female bear <em>a child</em>
<em>saying</em>\, “Where are My ‘Partners
is a witness
will be lost to them
that they have no place of escape
Man does not tire
he despairs\, <em>and </em>gives up <em>all </em>hope
and I do not think the Hour will <em>ever</em> come
I shall surely have
hard punishment
turning aside
lo! he <em>starts </em>offering long prayers
you disbelieve in it
who is more astray
than one who
drifted
that thy Lord
is Witness over all things
they are surely in doubt
encompasses all things
and to those that preceded thee
Allah\, the Mighty\, the Wise
whatever is in the heavens
and whatever is in the earth
and He is the High\, the Great
The heavens may well-nigh
on the earth
Behold! it is surely Allah
Most Forgiving\, the Merciful
protectors beside Him
Allah watches over them
and thou art not a guardian over them
the Mother of towns
and all around it
</I>of the Day of Gathering
whereof there is no doubt
And if Allah had <em>so </em>pleased
they will have no protector
protectors other than Him
Who is the <em>real </em>Protector
And He quickens the dead
And in whatsoever you differ
the decision thereof <em>rests </em>with Allah
in Him I put my trust
<I> He is </I>the Maker of the heavens
pairs of your own selves
the keys of the heavens
the provision for whomsoever
Surely\, He knows all things full well
He has prescribed for you the religion
We have revealed to thee
Remain steadfast in obedience
and be not divided therein
Hard upon the idolaters
Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases
And they did not become divided
but after knowledge had come to them
for an appointed term
would surely have been decided between them
disquieting doubt concerning it
To this\, then\, do thou invite
as thou art commanded
I believe in whatever
Allah has sent down
Book
and I am commanded to judge justly
between us and you
accepted
severe punishment
with truth and <em>also </em>the Balance
that the Hour may be near at hand
Benignant to His servants
the Powerful\, the Mighty
We give him increase
but in the Hereafter he will have no share
lawful for them
Allah has not allowed
And surely the wrongdoers
Thou wilt see the wrongdoers
the great bounty
except<I> that I am inviting you to God because of </I>love of kinship
And whoso earns a good deed
We give him increase
Most Forgiving\, Most Appreciating
Do they say
Allah had <em>so</em> willed
thy heart
But Allah is blotting out falsehood
sins
what you do
who believe and do good works
out of His grace
the provision for His servants
as He pleases
Indeed\, He is All-Aware and All-Seeing with regard to His servants
they have despaired
and spreads out His mercy
And He is the Protector\, the Praiseworthy
And among His Signs
the heavens and the earth
and <em>of </em>whatever living creatures He has spread forth in both
And He has the power to gather them together when He pleases
And whatever misfortune befalls you
is due to what your own hands have wrought
many
And you cannot frustrate
He can cause the wind to become still
upon the surface thereof
of that which they (the men) have earned
And <em>He destroys them so that</em> those who dispute about the Signs of Allah may know
they have no refuge
And whatever you have been given
sins and indecencies
and\, when they are wroth
they forgive
and who spend out of what We have provided for them
a wrong is done to them
injury
with Allah
But there is no blame on those who defend themselves after they have been wronged
without justification
that surely is a matter of strong determination
Allah adjudges astray
there is no protector for him thereafter
And those who believe will say
The losers indeed
are those who ruin
Behold
a lasting punishment
And they have no helpers
there is no way <em>at all</em>
There will be no refuge for you
We have not sent thee
as a guardian over them
Thy duty is only to convey <I>the Message</I>
We cause man to taste
of mercy from Us
their hands have sent forth
then lo! man
heavens and the earth
All-Knowing\, Powerful
And it is not for a man
By this perspicuous Book
the Reminder from you
and the example of the earlier peoples has gone before
The Mighty\, the All-Knowing <em>God </em>created them
and We thereby quicken
and we had not
And to our Lord surely shall we return.

They have no knowledge whatsoever of that
They do nothing but conjecture

Why has not this Qur’an been sent

And <em>the fact </em>that you are partners in punishment will not profit you this day for you have acted wrongfully.

Allah only forbids you

those believers whose wives have gone away

in Whom you believe
believing women come to thee
that they will not associate anything with Allah

make not friends

He will forgive you

So a party of the children of Israel believed

Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah

death comes upon one of you

And Allah will not grant respite

and the end of its affair was
O ye men of understanding
Allah has indeed sent down
the clear Signs of Allah
that he may bring those who believe and do good deeds out
through which rivers flow
Allah has indeed made excellent
provision for him
The <em>divine </em>command comes down

Allah has made lawful
Allah has indeed allowed
the Prophet confided a matter unto one of his wives
and she then divulged
and Allah informed him of it
<em>mentioning </em>part<I> of it</I>
The All-Knowing\, the All-Aware <em>God </em>has informed me
you two turn unto Allah repentant\, <em>it will be better for you</em>
and your hearts are <em>already so</em> inclined
and furthermore\, <em>all other </em>angels <em>too </em>
It may be that\, if he divorce you\, his Lord
who disobey not
make no excuses
You are requited
will remove
the evil<I> consequences </I>of your deeds
and an evil destination it is
No incongruity
Then look again
the lowest heaven
has not revealed
you are
we should not have been
Do you feel secure
He will not send
the birds
Or who is he that

The disbelievers
Or who is he that
and I am only
And for thee\, most surely
unending
So comply not
And yield not
And they made no exception
talking to one another in low tones
determined to
Why do you not glorify
Then some of them turned
will give us instead
our Lord
Have you
That you shall surely have
till
when the truth shall be laid bare
they will not be able
and they were indeed
And I give them respite
Dost thou ask a reward of them
Had not
But his Lord chose him
Nay\, it is naught
by a fierce roaring wind
a severe seizing
the waters rose high
And the earth and the mountains are heaved up
And the heaven will cleave asunder
And he did not urge
save
And it is not
the true certainty
the measure of which is
And the mountains will become
the Day of Judgment
the Garden of Bliss
a grievous punishment.
And every time
therein as a light
the open ways
have only added to
a mighty plan
Forsake not
And forsake neither
they have led many astray
so increase Thou not
And they found no
And Noah said
leave not
and will not give birth
and increase Thou not
and we will not associate
would never raise
And some of us
are otherwise
we cannot frustrate
so call not
they crowd upon him
and I associate no
there is
until
and He reveals not
that
all things
all that
in a decent manner
and give them a little respite
and a painful punishment
like crumbling sandhills
will be rent asunder
for nearly
seeking
And bestow not favours
the trumpet
distressful day
nineteen <em>angels</em>
And We have not fixed

Never! verily

And one shank rubs
For he neither accepted <I>the truth</I>
Was he not
And they feed
for Allah’s pleasure
So Allah will save them
and its clustered fruits will be brought within easy reach
tempered with
and a great kingdom
fine green silk
This
and yield not to
Allah has <em>so </em>willed
Did We not destroy
Did We not create you
a known measure
Have We not made
they shall not<I> be able to </I>speak
they do not bow down
In which word then
the great Event
a bright lamp
We will give you no increase
They shall not have the powe
to address Him
they shall not speak
when man will see
a losing return
a single cry
the great Sign
So Allah seized him
And He has made its night dark
along with it
the great disaster
they had not tarried
Though thou art not
he does not become purified
He makes the Way easy for him
he has not yet done
Now let man look
a noble Messenger
the clear horizon
O man
thy Gracious Lord
And they will not
shall have no power to do
a terrible day
for this
they were not sent
He will soon have
He will soon call for
he would never return
sees him full wel
they do not bow down in submissio
an unending
And <em>by </em>the Promised Day
a glorious Qur’an
guarded tablet
There is no
So let man consider
Then he will have no
a decisive word
and thou shalt forget <em>it </em>not
he will neither die
the former Scriptures
They will have no
Do they not then look
the greatest punishment
And the Ten Nights
have not been created
And you urge not one another
broken into pieces
And thy Lord comes
like unto His punishment
unto His binding
well pleased
We have surely created
Have We not given
But he attempted not
He indeed <em>truly </em>prospers
Then the Messenger of Allah said
And He cared not for
And his wealth shall not avail him
And to Us belongs
a flaming Fire
And he owes no favour to anyone
has not forsaken thee
And thy Lord will soon give thee
Have We not opened
unending
yield not thou to him
They
And the earth brings forth
And man says
will men come forth
By the snorting chargers
And penetrating thereby into the centre
like scattered moths
And the mountains will be
like carded wool
a pleasant life
a burning Fire
you will soon come to know
Did He not cause
fed them against
against fear
And urges not
the feeding

They like
And I am not
who goes about
And there is none
like unto Him
sneaking whisperer
