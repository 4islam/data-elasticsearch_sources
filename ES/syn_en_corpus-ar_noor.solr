All-Accomplisher => فَعَّالٌ
doer => فَعَّالٌ
then your turn comes => فَعَاقَبۡتُمۡ
then retaliate => فَعَاقِبُوا
then balanced you => فَعَدَلَکَ
then We forgave them => فَعَفَوۡنَا
and He has hastened => فَعَجَّلَ
then astonishing => فَعَجَبٌ
dealt => فَعَلَ
did => فَعَلَ
done => فَعَلَ
did it => فَعَلَہٗ
then on => فَعَلٰی

then upon him => فَعَلَیۡہِ
then upon them => فَعَلَیۡہِمۡ
then for them => فَعَلَیۡہِنَّ
then upon you => فَعَلَیۡکُمُ
and He knew => فَعَلِمَ
But He knew => فَعَلِمَ
Then they will know => فَعَلِمُوۡۤا
they do => فَعَلۡنَ
We dealt => فَعَلۡنَا
done => فَعَلۡتَ
you did => فَعَلۡتَ
you did so => فَعَلۡتَ
I did it => فَعَلۡتُہَاۤ
I did it => فَعَلۡتُہٗ
you did => فَعَلۡتُم
you have done => فَعَلۡتُمۡ
had done => فَعَلُوا
they did => فَعَلُوا
they do => فَعَلُوا
they (would) have done it => فَعَلُوۡہُ
they did => فَعَلُوۡہُ
they did [it] => فَعَلُوۡہُ
they have done so => فَعَلُوۡہُ
they would have done it => فَعَلُوۡہُ
But (will) be obscure => فَعَمِیَتۡ
so they became blind => فَعَمُوا
and hamstrung => فَعَقَرَ
Then they hamstrung => فَعَقَرُوا
and they hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
But they hamstrung her => فَعَقَرُوۡہَا
and he recognized them => فَعَرَفَہُمۡ
And they disobeyed => فَعَصَوۡا
But perhaps => فَعَسَی
But disobeyed => فَعَصٰی
it may be => فَعَصٰی
then perhaps => فَعَسٰۤی
But they rebelled => فَعَتَوۡا
so We strengthened them => فَعَزَّزۡنَا
then a prescribed number => فَعِدَّۃٌ
then prescribed number => فَعِدَّۃٌ
then their waiting period => فَعِدَّتُہُنَّ
for with => فَعِنۡدَ
then with => فَعِنۡدَ
then advise them => فَعِظُوۡہُنَّ
your deed => فَعۡلَتَکَ
but (it) has been obscured => فَعُمِّیَتۡ
And We gave understanding of it => فَفَہَّمۡنٰہَا
So I fled => فَفَرَرۡتُ
So a party => فَفَرِیۡقًا
and he rebelled => فَفَسَقَ
but they defiantly disobey => فَفَسَقُوا
So We opened => فَفَتَحۡنَاۤ
then We parted them => فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا
and he was afraid => فَفَزِعَ
and will be terrified => فَفَزِعَ
then a ransom => فَفِدۡیَۃٌ
So flee => فَفِرُّوۡۤا
then (they will be) in => فَفِیۡ
So covered them => فَغَشّٰٮہَا
but covered them => فَغَشِیَہُم
Then He forgave => فَغَفَرَ
So We forgave => فَغَفَرۡنَا
and erred => فَغَوٰی
and shackle him => فَغُلُّوۡہُ
So they were defeated => فَغُلِبُوا
And this => فَہٰذَا
And he gathered => فَحَشَرَ
but surrounded => فَحَاقَ
then surrounded => فَحَاقَ
so We took it to account => فَحَاسَبۡنٰہَا
So (are) vain => فَحَبِطَتۡ
So give => فَہَبۡ
narrate => فَحَدِّثۡ
And guided => فَہَدَی
so He guided => فَہَدٰی
then guided => فَہَدٰی
We guided them => فَہَدَیۡنٰہُمۡ
so are => فَہَل
But will => فَہَلۡ
so can => فَہَلۡ
So have => فَہَلۡ
So is => فَہَلۡ
So may => فَہَلۡ
So will => فَہَلۡ
Then do => فَہَلۡ
Then is => فَہَلۡ
Then will => فَہَلۡ
Then would => فَہَلۡ
So she conceived him => فَحَمَلَتۡہُ
so (is) proved true => فَحَقَّ
so (was) just => فَحَقَّ
So has been proved true => فَحَقَّ
so was fulfilled => فَحَقَّ
Then enough for him => فَحَسۡبُہٗ
then greet => فَحَیُّوا
So they defeated them => فَہَزَمُوۡہُم
and they => فَہِیَ
so it => فَہِیَ
so they => فَہِیَ
then its ruling => فَحُکۡمُہٗۤ
so they => فَہُم
[so] they => فَہُمۡ
and they => فَہُمۡ
but they => فَہُمۡ
so (that) they => فَہُمۡ
so they => فَہُمۡ
then they => فَہُمۡ
then (would) they => فَہُمُ
and he => فَہُوَ
and it => فَہُوَ
but it => فَہُوَ
So he => فَہُوَ
then He => فَہُوَ
then it => فَہُوَ
mountain highway => فَجٍّ
and came => فَجَآءَ
and came to it => فَجَآءَہَا
Then came to him => فَجَآءَتۡہُ
and they came to them => فَجَآءُوۡہُم
and they entered => فَجَاسُوا
and He made => فَجَعَلَ
Then made => فَجَعَلَ
and has made (for) him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
and made him => فَجَعَلَہٗ
And then makes it => فَجَعَلَہٗ
So he made them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
Then He made them => فَجَعَلَہُمۡ
and We make it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
So We made it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہَا
and We will make them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
so We made (for) him => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
Then We placed it => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُ
and We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
so We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمۡ
but We made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُمُ
And We have made them => فَجَعَلۡنٰہُنَّ
And We made => فَجَعَلۡنَا
and you have made => فَجَعَلۡتُم
and put together => فَجَمَعَ
then We (will) gather them => فَجَمَعۡنٰہُمۡ
then penalty => فَجَزَآءٌ
then his recompense => فَجَزَآؤُہٗ
the open space => فَجۡوَۃٍ
So were assembled => فَجُمِعَ
thought => فَکَّرَ
freeing => فَکُّ
but he denied => فَکَذَّبَ
but we denied => فَکَذَّبۡنَا
but you denied => فَکَذَّبۡتَ
and they denied => فَکَذَّبُوا
But they denied => فَکَذَّبُوا
But they denied him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
So they denied him => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُ
but they denied both of them => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
So they denied them => فَکَذَّبُوۡہُمَا
and thus => فَکَذٰلِکَ
then she has lied => فَکَذَبَتۡ
then (it is) as though => فَکَاَنَّمَا
then (it) is as if => فَکَاَنَّمَا
then (it) is as if => فَکَاَنَّمَاۤ
And how many => فَکَاَیِّنۡ
and We removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا
So We have removed => فَکَشَفۡنَا
and became => فَکَانَ
and he became => فَکَانَ
and was => فَکَانَ
and were => فَکَانَ
his parents were => فَکَانَ
it was => فَکَانَ
so he was => فَکَانَ
So will be => فَکَانَ
and become => فَکَانَتۡ
and becomes => فَکَانَتۡ
and it becomes => فَکَانَتۡ
it was => فَکَانَتۡ
So they become => فَکَانَتۡ
and they became => فَکَانُوا
but they were => فَکَانُوا
so they became => فَکَانُوا
they will be => فَکَانُوا
then give them (the) writing => فَکَاتِبُوۡہُمۡ
magnify => فَکَبِّرۡ
but He restrained => فَکَفَّ
So its expiation => فَکَفّٰرَتُہٗۤ
but it denied => فَکَفَرَتۡ
But they disbelieved => فَکَفَرُوا
So they disbelieved => فَکَفَرُوا
So sufficient => فَکَفٰی
Nay you would hate it => فَکَرِہۡتُمُوۡہُ
then We clothed => فَکَسَوۡنَا
and He increased you => فَکَثَّرَکُمۡ
and how => فَکَیۡفَ
so how => فَکَیۡفَ
So how could => فَکَیۡفَ
Then how => فَکَیۡفَ
jesting => فَکِہِیۡنَ
then plan against Me => فَکِیۡدُوۡنِ
So plot against me => فَکِیۡدُوۡنِیۡ
will be cast down => فَکُبَّتۡ
Then they will be overturned => فَکُبۡکِبُوا
So each => فَکُلًّا
and you both eat => فَکُلَا
So eat => فَکُلِیۡ
So eat => فَکُلُوا
then eat => فَکُلُوا
then eat it => فَکُلُوۡہُ
and you used => فَکُنۡتُم
but you used => فَکُنۡتُمۡ
So surely I will cut off => فَلَاُقَطِّعَنَّ
[then] no => فَلَا
[then] not => فَلَا
and (do) not => فَلَا
And not => فَلَا
but (do) not => فَلَا
but (there will be) no => فَلَا
But no => فَلَا
But not => فَلَا
let not => فَلَا
no => فَلَا
So (do) not => فَلَا
so (let) not => فَلَا
so (that) not => فَلَا
so let them not => فَلَا
so no => فَلَا
so not => فَلَا
Then (do) not => فَلَا
then (let there be) no => فَلَا
then (there is) no => فَلَا
then (there will be) no => فَلَا
Then do not => فَلَا
then no => فَلَا
then none => فَلَا
Then not => فَلَا
But nay => فَلَاۤ
then (there is) no => فَلَاۤ
then no => فَلَاۤ
Then not => فَلَاۤ
Surely wretched => فَلَبِئۡسَ
and he remained => فَلَبِثَ
so he remained => فَلَبِثَ
Then you remained => فَلَبِثۡتَ
Then perhaps you would => فَلَعَلَّکَ
Then possibly you => فَلَعَلَّکَ
and you would know them => فَلَعَرَفۡتَہُم
So (the) curse => فَلَعۡنَۃُ
then for her => فَلَہَا
then it is for it => فَلَہَا
to Him => فَلَہُ
then for him => فَلَہٗ
so for him => فَلَہٗۤ
so to Him => فَلَہٗۤ
then for them => فَلَہُمَا
so for them => فَلَہُمۡ
then for them => فَلَہُمۡ
then for them => فَلَہُنَّ
an orbit => فَلَکٍ
then for you => فَلَکُمۡ
then for you => فَلَکُمُ
and when => فَلَمَّا
But when => فَلَمَّا
So when => فَلَمَّا
Then when => فَلَمَّا
when => فَلَمَّا
Yet when => فَلَمَّا
and when => فَلَمَّاۤ
But when => فَلَمَّاۤ
So when => فَلَمَّاۤ
and they touched it => فَلَمَسُوۡہُ
and (do) not => فَلَمۡ
And not => فَلَمۡ
But did not => فَلَمۡ
But not => فَلَمۡ
so not => فَلَمۡ
and never => فَلَنۡ
But never => فَلَنۡ
never => فَلَنۡ
so never => فَلَنۡ
then never => فَلَنۡ
surely we will come to them => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّہُم
Then we will surely produce for you => فَلَنَاۡتِیَنَّکَ
Then surely We will narrate => فَلَنَقُصَّنَّ
Then surely We will question => فَلَنَسۡـَٔلَنَّ
and Best => فَلَنِعۡمَ
so never => فَلَنۡ
so not => فَلَنۡ
But surely We will cause to taste => فَلَنُذِیۡقَنَّ
then surely We will give him life => فَلَنُحۡیِیَنَّہٗ
But We will surely inform => فَلَنُنَبِّئَنَّ
So We will surely turn you => فَلَنُوَلِّیَنَّکَ
and surely they (would have) fought you => فَلَقٰتَلُوۡکُمۡ
so surely soon => فَلَسَوۡفَ
And if => فَلَوۡ
Then if => فَلَوۡ
So if not => فَلَوۡلَا
so why (do) not => فَلَوۡلَا
So why not => فَلَوۡلَا
Then why (did) not => فَلَوۡلَا
then why not => فَلَوۡلَا
And if not => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
then why not => فَلَوۡلَاۤ
And will surely make evident => فَلَیَعۡلَمَنَّ
so not => فَلَیۡسَ
then he is not => فَلَیۡسَ
Then not => فَلَیۡسَ
then not he => فَلَیۡسَ
then not is => فَلَیۡسَ
so they will surely cut off => فَلَیُبَتِّکُنَّ
so they will surely change => فَلَیُغَیِّرُنَّ
So to that => فَلِذٰلِکَ
then for themselves => فَلِاَنۡفُسِہِمۡ
then it is for yourself => فَلِاَنۡفُسِکُمۡ
then for his mother => فَلِاُمِّہِ
then for each => فَلِکُلِّ
then the male will have => فَلِلذَّکَرِ
but for Allah => فَلِلّٰہِ
for Allah => فَلِلّٰہِ
then for Allah => فَلِلّٰہِ
with Allah => فَلِلّٰہِ
for parents => فَلِلۡوٰلِدَیۡنِ
So why => فَلِمَ
Then why => فَلِمَ
then (it is) for his soul => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
then it is for his soul => فَلِنَفۡسِہٖ
then let stand => فَلۡتَقُمۡ
Then let them taste it => فَلۡیَذُوۡقُوۡہُ
then let him eat => فَلۡیَاۡکُلۡ
Then let bring => فَلۡیَاۡتِ
and let him bring to you => فَلۡیَاۡتِکُم
So let him bring us => فَلۡیَاۡتِنَا
Then let them bring => فَلۡیَاۡتُوا
Then let him call => فَلۡیَدۡعُ
So let them laugh => فَلۡیَضۡحَکُوا
So let them worship => فَلۡیَعۡبُدُوا
let work => فَلۡیَعۡمَلِ
let him do => فَلۡیَعۡمَلۡ
let them rejoice => فَلۡیَفۡرَحُوا
So let beware => فَلۡیَحۡذَرِ
let him disbelieve => فَلۡیَکۡفُرۡ
So let him write => فَلۡیَکۡتُبۡ
then let them be => فَلۡیَکُوۡنُوا
then let him extend => فَلۡیَمۡدُدۡ
then surely will extend => فَلۡیَمۡدُدۡ
So let see => فَلۡیَنۡظُرِ
Then let look => فَلۡیَنۡظُرِ
and let him see => فَلۡیَنۡظُرۡ
then let him see => فَلۡیَنۡظُرۡ
Then let them ascend => فَلۡیَرۡتَقُوا
then let them ask permission => فَلۡیَسۡتَـٔۡذِنُوا
then he should refrain => فَلۡیَسۡتَعۡفِفۡ
and let them respond => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوا
So let them respond => فَلۡیَسۡتَجِیۡبُوا
then he should fast in it => فَلۡیَصُمۡہُ
So let them fear => فَلۡیَتَّقُوا
let aspire => فَلۡیَتَنَافَسِ
[so] let put (their) trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
[so] put (their) trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
let put (their) trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
so let put (their) trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
so let put the trust => فَلۡیَتَوَکَّلِ
then let discharge => فَلۡیُؤَدِّ
let him believe => فَلۡیُؤۡمِنۡ
then let cast it => فَلۡیُلۡقِہِ
then let dictate => فَلۡیُمۡلِلۡ
let him spend => فَلۡیُنۡفِقۡ
So let fight => فَلۡیُقٰتِلۡ
