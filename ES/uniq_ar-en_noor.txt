The mother shall not make <i>the father</i> suffer on account of her child
and the same is incumbent on the heir
nor shall he to whom the child belongs make <i>the mother</i> suffer on account of his child
provided you pay what you have agreed to pay
Allah knows all things well
good you do
of good and abundant wealth you spend
to be free from want because of <i>their</i> abstaining <i>from begging</i>
And if Allah did not repel some men
I am not going to stretch out
every soul be requited
would never change
Messengers from among angels
these are ten complete
those among you who have done wrong
Promotion of their welfare is <i>an act of</i> great goodness
Their religion has deluded these<I> men</I>
and that your hearts might thereby be set at rest
but <i>I ask this</i> that my heart may be at rest
Allah will enrich you
And no soul knows
and no soul knows
in keeping <i>the desire</i> hidden in your minds
you say a fair word
Behold! it is surely Allah
I perfected your religion for you
Those who believe
and ask Allah to forgive them
it is for them certainly a means of drawing near
the <i>maximum</i> period of waiting is four months
the forbidden months have passed
to those of them whom thou pleasest
vow <i>abstinence</i> from their wives
And whoso earns a good deed
and seek not what is bad
Allah breaks not <em>His</em> promise
And those who disbelieve will not cease to be
and is then transgressed against
They esteem not Allah
to the extent to which he has transgressed
If they both decide upon weaning <i>the child</i> by mutual consent and consultation

thereafter Allah will bring something new to pass

And Allah will certainly reward
And he who turns back

Those of the believers who sit <em>still</em>\, excepting the disabled ones
would never raise
Allah has indeed sent down
Thus does Allah make His commandments clear to you
a Messenger or a Prophet before thee
and ‘Ra‘ina\,’ screening with their tongues <em>what is in their minds</em> and <em>seeking</em> to injure the Faith
He makes the night cover the day
This is Allah\, your Lord
Whoso desires
ou are thankful and <em>if</em> you believe
should Allah punish you
plea against Allah
It may be that Allah
And Allah knows what is in your hearts
And Allah is All-Knowing
then <em>the offender</em> shall free a believing slave
they to whom Allah turns with mercy
an abundant place of refuge and plentifulness
there is no blame on you
what their right hands possess
whatever is in the heavens
to guide him whom Allah has caused to perish
And they have no helpers
appear to us alike
In both there is great sin and also <i>some</i> advantages for men
Thus does Allah make His Signs clear to you
and that a fiery whirlwind should smite it and it be <i>all</i> burnt
and with all kinds of fruit for him therein
four of you against them
Allah has indeed made excellent
the clear Signs of Allah
and Allah lets the wrongdoers go astray
with such of the believers as give alms of their own free will

And when there comes to them any tidings <i>whether</i> of peace or of fear
that they cannot observe the limits <i>prescribed</i> by Allah
that they would be able to observe the limits <i>prescribed</i> by Allah
And those who were given the Book did not disagree
Allah has ordained for us
Their Messengers said to them

while there has not come over you

And a covenant
they would not turn their backs

Then the Messenger of Allah said
These are the Signs of Allah
and the purpose of Allah prevailed
and they devised plots against thee

But Allah came upon them
You did not think
they did not expect
whence
<i>should remember that</i> there is <i>to be</i> no foul talk
The months of the Hajj
nor any quarrelling
nor any transgression
O Abraham
O Iblis
O Adam
beside Allah
not to Allah
And the answer of his people was no
And if any <i>debtor</i> be in straitened circumstances
They have no knowledge whatsoever of that
Who causes the grain and the date-stones to sprou
and all things that Allah has created
there are lofty mansions built over lofty mansions
The Jews and the Christians say
on which the name of Allah has not been pronounced
turns his back to them on such a day
But their faith could not profit them
fire into their bellies
beneath which rivers flow
through which rivers flow
through which streams flow
with streams flowing beneath it
Satan has smitten with insanity
Trade <i>also</i> is like interest
and to be ungrateful to Him and <i>to hinder men from</i> the Sacred Mosque
fighting in the Sacred Month
with dark patches of night
wherein the name of Allah is oft commemorated
or <em>if</em> one of you comes from the privy
or you have touched women and you find no water
except that it be ready merchandise
There should be no compulsion in religion
right has become distinct from wrong
if you have no
they have no child
What reason have we to abstain from fighting
<em>let him</em> marry what your right hands possess
How many a small party
and he who had<I> already </I>come to life through a clear Sign might live
so that he who had<I> already </I>perished through a clear Sign might perish
it is your righteousness that reaches Him
then <em>the offender shall pay</em> blood money to be handed over to his heirs
his reward lies on Allah
And sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of affairs
on one another
one another
And let none of you look back
Is he then whose bosom Allah has opened for <em>the acceptance of</em> Islam
or he\, in whose hand is the tie of marriage\, should remit
except that <em>you earn</em> by trade with mutual consent
And let not those who disbelieve think that
evil suggestion from Satan incite thee
And a curse was made to follow them in this <em>life </em>
do those who commit evil deeds think
And their prayer at the House is nothing but
And this life of the world is nothing
share in the Hereafter
the parents and the relations leave
whether it be little
put each of them on a hill
Neither your ties of kindred nor your children will avail you aught
Satan made their deeds<I> seem </I>fair to them
love between you and those of them with whom you are <em>now </em>at enmity
Allah has appointed
for which He has sent down no authority
of the Book! believe in what We have sent down
for Allah’s appointed time is certainly coming
And among the sacred Signs of Allah We have appointed for you the sacrificial camels
